However, the Minor and Secondary Major options are not applicable to students who are admitted to Senior Year programme.

# Minor study

Minor study will be a free choice by students and not mandatory. Each student is allowed to take not more than one Minor. Students who opt for Minor study will be subject to the following regulations:

(i) A Minor programme is a collection of subjects totalling 18 credits with at least  $50\%$  (9 credits) of the subjects at Level 3 or above;  
(ii) Students interested in a Minor must submit their applications to and obtain approval from the Minor-offering department, no later than the commencement of second year of study. Students should submit their applications to their Major department, which will indicate its support or otherwise (since the taking of a Minor will increase the student's study load), before the Minor-offering department makes a final decision on the application;  
(iii) Students are expected to complete their approved Minor as part of their graduation requirements. Students who wish to withdraw from a Minor need to apply for approval officially from the Minor offering department, before the end of the add/drop period of the last Semester of study;  
(iv) Students with approved Minor will be given a higher priority in taking the Minor subjects over the students who take the subjects as free-electives. ‘Free electives’ under the 4-year Ug degree programmes refers to any subjects offered by the University, unless otherwise specified;  
(v) Subject to approval by the Minor-offering department, students may count up to 6 credits from their Major/General University Requirements (GUR) [including Language Communication Requirement (LCR) subjects at proficiency level] towards their chosen Minor. Nevertheless, students must take at least 6 credits from their chosen Minor programme in order to satisfy the residential requirement of their chosen Minor. In

addition, to be eligible for the Major and Minor awards, the total number of credits taken by the students for their Major-Minor studies must not be lower than the credit requirement of the single discipline Major programme;

(vi) Credit transfer can be given for not more than 9 credits of a Minor programme if the previous credits were earned from approved institutions outside of the university; and not more than 12 credits of a Minor programme if the previous credits were earned from programmes offered by PolyU;  
(vii) Only students with a GPA of 2.5 or above can be considered for Minor study enrolment. The Minor-offering department may set a quota and additional admission requirements for their Minor; and  
(viii) Students are required to obtain a GPA of at least 1.70 in order to satisfy the requirement for graduation with a Major plus a Minor.

Note: There is no guarantee that a clash-free timetable can be provided for all students who pursue Minor study.

Secondary Major (only applicable to students opting BEng (Hons) in ESIoT as their Major)

Studying on a Secondary Major is a free choice by students and not mandatory. Each student may take not more than one Secondary Major. Students who opt for a Secondary Major will be subject to the following regulations:

(i) Students are expected to complete the "X (Major in Electronic Systems & Internet-of-Things) + Secondary Major" within the normal duration of the major programme.  
(ii) Students may count up to 12 credits of their Major/GUR subjects towards the Secondary Major. Nevertheless, students must take at least 12 credits from their chosen Secondary Major in order to satisfy the residential requirement of the chosen Secondary Major. Students who have completed more than 12 credits of subjects that are eligible for double counting will need to apply for graduation and indicate the subjects intended for double counting.  
(iii) Students must apply to and obtain approval from the programme offering Department, normally no later than the commencement of the second year of study, to be admitted to the Secondary Major.  
(iv) Only students with a Cumulative GPA of 2.70 or above may be considered for Secondary Major enrolment. Each Secondary Major may stipulate additional selection criteria for admission.  
(v) Students must complete the Secondary Major as part of their graduation requirements. Students who wish to withdraw from the Secondary Major must obtain approval from the programme offering Department normally before the end of the add/drop period of the last semester of study.  
(vi) If deemed appropriate by the programme offering Department, students are allowed to take a Major with a Secondary Major and a Minor. Subjects already double-counted for the Major and Secondary Major cannot be used to fulfil the Minor requirement.

The Secondary Major in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) can be found in the in Appendix II.

Fast-track Integrated Bachelor's and Master's Degree Programme (only applicable to students opting BEng (Hons) in ESIoT or BSc (Hons) in IS as their Major)

# 2 BEng (Hons) / BSc (Hons) Scheme in Information and Artificial Intelligence Engineering

# 2.1 Background and Rationale

We are living in a smart era in which many of our daily decision-making processes are based on the collection, processing, analysis, and interpretation of a large amount of data and information. The availability of Internet-of-Things technologies enables us to collect virtually any data that are useful to our decision-making from virtually anywhere, while artificial intelligence and information engineering provide the powerful computational tools for analysing the collected data intelligently and efficiently to provide us with firmly grounded rationale for decision making. To take advantage of these technologies, various hardware and software systems are required to be closely interconnected through very complex information networks, thus posing security risks when a massive amount of data and information flows through these networks. It is therefore vitally important to protect and safeguard them against various forms of cyber attacks. The Scheme encompasses three programmes that are aimed at training professionals who are interested in working in the three closely related and mutually supporting technological areas mentioned above, namely, (1) electronic systems and Internet of Things; (2) artificial intelligence and information engineering; and (3) information security. Depending on their own areas of interest, students admitted into the Scheme are allowed to choose to specialize in one of these three areas.

# 5 BSc (Hons) in Information Security

# 5.1 Rationale

The recent advance in information and communication technologies (ICT) has brought people great convenience in their daily life. Information has become one of the most valuable assets to any country and any business which requires careful protection. To protect data security and privacy and to safeguard against the risk of potentially devastating security attacks and misuses have thus become a vital concern to all countries and organizations. With the cross-border, open-platform, highly-interconnected nature of the cyberworld, the impacts of security attacks and misuses are far-reaching, and would require integral effort from all parties involved in order to effectively combat these attacks.

In Hong Kong, since the pace of globalization continues to accelerate, supported by domestic consumption as well as the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the manpower requirement in ICT will follow a growing trend in the long run. However, the further transition to knowledge society and the shifting of the ICT sector towards Cloud Computing and mobile communications requires ICT employees to acquire new skills and knowledge particularly in the area of information security. There is a need to launch relevant degree programmes to satisfy the urgent needs of the society. This programme will thus cover both large-scale and small-scale information security issues which are facing by individuals, organisations, and the society, and provide the necessary training to students so that they will be capable of preventing security threats and solving security problems in different settings.

# 6.1 Summary of University Graduation Requirements

To be eligible for a Bachelor's Degree award under the 4-year full-time undergraduate curriculum, a student must:

(i) Successfully complete a minimum of 120 academic credits (64 to 67 academic credits for Senior Year Intake) and 2 to 8 training credits\*;  
(ii) Earn a cumulative GPA of 1.70 or above at graduation;  
(iii) Successfully complete the mandatory Work-Integrated Education (WIE) component;  
(iv) Satisfy the following General University Requirements (GUR):

Normal Year 1 Intake  

<table><tr><td>(a) Language and Communication Requirements1</td><td>9 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(b) Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics Requirement</td><td>2 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(c) Innovation and Entrepreneurship Requirement</td><td>1 credit</td></tr><tr><td>(c) Leadership Education and Development</td><td>3 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(d) Service-Learning</td><td>3 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(e) Cluster Areas Requirement (CAR)
[3 credits each from CAR (A), CAR (M) and CAR (N)]</td><td>9 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(g) Healthy Lifestyle</td><td>Non-credit bearing</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>27 credits</td></tr></table>

Senior Year Intake  

<table><tr><td>(a) Language and Communication Requirements1</td><td>Normally not required2</td></tr><tr><td>(b) Service-Learning</td><td>3 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(c) Cluster Areas Requirement (CAR)
[3 credits each from CAR(A)3 and CAR(M)]</td><td>6 credits</td></tr><tr><td>(d) Essential Components of General Education</td><td>Non-credit bearing</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>9 credits</td></tr></table>

(v) Satisfy the residential requirement for at least one-third of the credits to be completed for the award; and  
(vi) Satisfy all requirements as defined and/or stipulated in the Programme Requirement Document and as specified by the University.

There are subjects which are designed to fulfil the credit requirement of different types of subjects. Students passing these subjects will be regarded as having fulfilled the credit requirements of the particular types of subjects concerned. Nevertheless, the subject passed will only be counted once in fulfilling the credit requirements of the award, and the students will be required to take another subject in order to meet the total credit requirement of the programme concerned.

Level-0 subjects and training subjects (including clinical/field training) will not be counted to fulfill free elective requirement for graduation purpose.

Senior Year intakes admitted to the 4-year Undergraduate Degree programmes on the strength of the Associate Degree/Higher Diploma qualifications are required to complete at least 60 credits in order to be eligible for a Bachelor's degree. Exemption may be given for subjects already taken in the previous Associate Degree/Higher Diploma studies. In that case, students should take other electives (including free electives) instead to make up the total of 60 credits required.

A student is required to graduate as soon as he/she satisfies the graduation requirements as stipulated above. The student concerned is required to apply for graduation, in the semester in which he/she is able to fulfil all his/her graduation requirements, and after the add/drop period for that semester has ended.

# Students taking the Major/Minor option

Students taking the Major/Minor option will be considered for an award when they have satisfied the requirements for both the Major and Minor studies (i.e., having a GPA of 1.70 or above) and have also submitted an application for graduation. If the 18 credits taken for the approved Minor study can meet the requirements for that Minor, the Major students may apply to graduate with a specific Minor, in addition to their Major. Otherwise, students will graduate with a Major only.

Subject to the approval by the Minor-offering Department, students may count up to 6 credits from their Major/GUR [including Language Communication Requirements (LCR) subjects at proficiency level] towards their chosen Minor. Nevertheless, students must take at least 6 credits from their chosen Minor programme in order to satisfy the residential requirement of their chosen Minor. In addition, to be eligible for the Major and Minor awards, the total number of credits taken by the students for their Major-Minor studies must not be lower than the credit requirement of the single discipline Major programme.

# Students taking the Major/Secondary Major option

Students may count up to 12 credits of their Major/GUR subjects towards the Secondary Major. Nevertheless, students must take at least 12 credits from their chosen Secondary Major in order to satisfy the residential requirement of the chosen Secondary Major. Students who have completed more than 12 credits of subjects that are eligible for double counting will need to apply for graduation and indicate the subjects intended for double counting. Notwithstanding the above, students must meet the minimum credit requirements of the “X + Secondary Major” concerned, i.e., 132 credits.

Table 6.6.6 Alignment of Subjects with Programme Intended Learning Outcomes

# 6.7 Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is considered to be of great importance. This is reflected in the number of credits it carries, being 6 credits which are equivalent to two standard-sized subjects. Furthermore, the result of the Capstone Project will be very important when the Board of Examiners considers the award classification of a student. Normally, the Board of Examiners will expect a very good grade for the Capstone Project when a student is to be awarded a high Honours classification.

One of the important features of the Capstone Project is "learning by doing". It is intended to be a platform for the students to develop their intellectual and innovative abilities and to give them the opportunities to integrate and apply the knowledge and analytical skills gained in previous stages of study. It should also provide students with opportunities to develop their problem-solving skills and communication skills. The process from conceptualization to final implementation and testing, through problem identification and the selection of appropriate solutions will be practised by the students.

# (i) Project Management

Normally each student will be assigned one project under the supervision of an academic staff member so that he/she will work independently to achieve the project objectives. In other cases, several students may work on different aspects of a large-scale project.

The assignment of projects is expected to be completed by the month of June preceding the beginning of the final year of study. Guidelines for Capstone Project are given to students at the beginning of the final year.

# (ii) Project Assessment

Assessment of the Capstone Project focuses on three main areas: project reports, oral presentations and work done over the whole project period. Assessment will be done by the project supervisor and an assessor. The Project Management Team, which is composed of the Programme Leader and staff members from teaching sections, will oversee the overall standard of assessment of the projects. The Project Management Team will also oversee the daily operation, such as fixing the dates of project report submission, oral presentation, demonstration, etc.

# 6.8 Industrial Centre (IC) Training

Industrial Centre (IC) Training is a practical training element to provide a chance for the students to develop hands-on experience in various engineering domains in order to prepare for a career in the engineering profession.

Students must pass all IC Training subjects. IC Training is graded in the normal manner from  $\mathrm{A + }$  to F and will be counted in the evaluation of the Grade Point Average (GPA). However, they will not be counted towards Weighted GPA or Award GPA. The assessment method of Industrial Centre Training is based on  $100\%$  continuous assessment. The assessment components are workshop reports, competency in practical works, and appreciation tests. To complete the IC Training successfully, students must demonstrate good professional attributes, including responsible attitude in training, excellent attendance with active learning, exercising best practice and care in equipment and tools while observing all safety codes. Details of the assessment scheme are available from Industrial Centre.

# 6.9 Work-Integrated Education

WIE is a mandatory component of the programme. There can be several routes or options for the students to pursue Work-Integrated Education (WIE). These options include the One-year Internship Scheme (OIS), industrial projects, summer internship and other workplace training opportunities provided by the University or found by students themselves, etc.

# 1. Credits Requirement

Students of BEng (Hons) in Electronic Systems and Internet-of-Things and BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence and Information Engineering are required to complete a minimum of 2 weeks of Work-Integrated Education (WIE) during the study period. Students of BSc (Hons) in Information Security who successfully complete the 4 weeks of Summer Internship (EIE3189) will fulfil the WIE requirement simultaneously. WIE training credits will not be counted towards the Grade Point Average (GPA) or the Weighted GPA (WGPA). After assessing the training performance, a Pass or a Fail grade will be awarded to the student on his/her WIE component.

# 2. Intended Learning Outcomes of WIE

Since WIE can take different forms and be applied to different kinds of job, the learning outcomes to be achieved vary depending on the job nature and its duration engaged by the student. However, based on the experience gained, WIE can bring a lot of advantages to students' learning both in the profession-specific areas and in their all-round development. The intended learning outcomes of WIE are elaborated in the following paragraph.

On successful completion of the WIE component, the students will be able to:

- Apply knowledge and skills learned from the Programme on the job in a broad context of networking and multimedia profession.  
- Recognize the operation and requirement of real-life business, leading to the development of entrepreneurship, global outlook, professional ethics, social and cultural understanding.  
- Recognize the expectation of employers, hence leading to better employability.  
Develop their all-round attributes such as interpersonal skills and leadership.  
- Develop their critical and creative thinking, and problem-solving skills while taking into account various real-life constraints, helping them to pursue life-long learning and continuing professional development.

# 3. WIE Options

WIE component under the Programme can be in many forms, including One-year Internship Scheme (OIS), industrial project, summer internship and other job opportunities.

# One-year Internship Scheme (OIS)

The OIS lasts for 1 year. Under the OIS, the students will pursue Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3 study in full time (or Year 1 for Senior Year Intake), and then engage in industrial training in Year 4 (or Year 2 for Senior Year Intake). After the industrial training year, the students will pursue their final-year study in full time again. Normally the students will graduate at the end of Year 5 (or Year 3 for Senior Year Intake) after having satisfied all programme requirements. Students who would like to join the OIS are required to submit an application to the Department prior to the commencement of the industrial training. They can choose to take subject(s) in a semester during the industrial training year but they will be required to pay a flat tuition fee.

Industrial Project (for BEng (Hons) in ESIoT and BSc (Hons) in AIIE only)

Industrial projects are Capstone Projects working with the industry. Students working on an industrial project will pursue the project in a company for a certain period. The students will work with a real-life project in the real working environment.

Summer Internship (for BSc (Hons) in IS only)

By taking EIE3189 Summer Internship, students will work in an ICT-related organization during summer months. Students can learn the operation and requirements of real-life ICT industry, and have the chance to apply the knowledge and skills learned from the Programme to a broad context and an ICT profession.

Other Job Opportunities

It is possible that students find jobs for themselves to work during the summer vacation or semester breaks. This kind of job opportunity will be judged by the Department whether it is helpful to the students in achieving the intended learning outcomes of WIE. The students and the Academic Advisor/WIE Coordinators will work collaboratively with regard to the job selection and the subsequent training contents. The Department will constantly monitor the progress. At the end of the training, an assessment will be made on the achievement of learning outcomes.

4. Guidelines for Operation and Supervision of WIE

The Department adopts a set of strategies to support students' learning in the workplace. The followings are the details of the operation at different stages.

# Preparation

The Department will actively align with the industry to get WIE placement opportunities for students. It is important for students to be fully aware of the benefits brought by WIE. Students will be asked to attend employment seminars as early as possible. Through this type of arrangement, students in all years will be well prepared for job hunting and employment in advance. Students will also be able to realize the benefits for engaging in WIE and the importance of taking an active role in completing the training with the best effort.

# Operation

There will be WIE Coordinators overseeing all matters related to WIE activities under the Programme. The WIE Coordinators are the academic staff members of the Department responsible for the organization and operation of WIE activities. To guide the students and monitor their progress in taking the WIE, each student will be assigned an academic advisor from the Department. The student and his/her Academic Advisor will jointly plan the WIE details, such as job selection, training plan, logging of activities, reporting, and assessment.

In the case that the student finds job placement(s) on his/her own, the Academic Advisor will work with the student to design the learning outcomes if the placement is suitable to be recognized as a WIE activity. The Academic Advisor will make frequent contacts with the student and, if appropriate, the employer to monitor the progress of the student.

Each student will be guided by his/her Academic Advisor when conducting the WIE training. The student's work will be monitored continuously and an assessment will be given when the WIE placement is completed.

# Assessment of the WIE Component(s)

The objective of assessment is to determine what the student has achieved through WIE. The actual type of work and duration will vary from case to case. Hence, an assessment framework is set out in the following as a general guideline.

Continuous Assessment

The Academic Advisor may visit the student during the training period so that the Academic Advisor and the employer will be able to discuss the student's performance together. This will give better feedback on the student's performance before the training is completed.

Report

After the training is completed, the student is required to submit a report to the Academic Advisor. The details to be contained in the report should be commensurate with the training duration. It contains a brief reflective writing on the training received, the objectives that have been achieved, and the experience gained. The student may also conduct a self-evaluation on his/her own performance. The report must be endorsed by the student's employer before its submission.

Employer Evaluation

At the end of the training period, the employer will provide an evaluation of the student's performance, assessing the student's work and all-round development.

Overall Assessment

An overall assessment of the student's performance will be made by the Academic Advisor by considering all the assessment components as stated in Section 7.9 (iv). A pass grade will be given to the student upon satisfactory completion of the WIE component; otherwise, a failure grade will be given.

# 7 Management and Operation

# 7.1 Administration

The daily operation of the programme, such as general administration of admission, registrations, student records, preparation for Board of Examiners meetings and documentations, is overseen by the Scheme/Programme Leader and the administrative team of the Department. All enquiries regarding registration and general administration from students on the programme should be made to the General Office as the first contact point.

The Departmental Programmes Committee (DPC), in which the Head of Department and the Scheme/Programme Leaders of all programmes offered by the Department are members, discusses and reviews the programme structure, syllabi content, high-level integration and future directions of the programme. The Departmental Learning and Teaching Committee (DLTC) advises on matters related to teaching methods and learning quality and cultivates the positive mentality toward teaching and learning among teaching staff and students. WIE/Career Liaison Officer and Student-Exchange Coordinator are appointed by the Department to provide students with advice and assistance.

# 7.2 Student-Staff Consultative Group (SSCG)

The Student-Staff Consultative Group consists of Student Representatives together with the Scheme/Programme Leader. The Committee is normally chaired by the Scheme/Programme Leader and meets at least twice a year. Issues to be kept under consideration include: student workload, teaching methods, balance between subject areas, training matters and other areas of mutual concern.

# 7.3 Academic Advising

While the Scheme/Programme Leader is available for the operation of the programme, general enquiries and counselling, Academic Advisors are in place to offer more personal contacts and to look after students' needs.

The Academic Advisors, usually an academic staff member, is assigned to each newly admitted student and he/she will be with the students till graduation. Academic Advisors provide continuous and individual counselling and help guide the students through various difficulties, if any, which might affect their studies. A specific staff member from the General Office will work closely with the Scheme/Programme Leaders and the Academic Advisors. All academic requirements and regulations related to academic programmes offered by the department as well as the GUR requirements will be provided to the students.

# 8 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment

The admission, registration and assessment arrangements described below are in accordance with the University policies and regulations for all 4-year full-time undergraduate degree programmes and articulation degree programmes.

# 8.1 Admission

Students in UGC-funded degree programmes will be recruited on a yearly basis.

# 8.2 Re-admission

Students who have been required to withdraw on grounds of academic failure or have been deregistered, and those who have discontinued their studies without completing the proper procedures for official withdrawal, shall not be considered for re-admission to the same scheme/programme/stream in the following academic year.

# 8.3 Transfer of study within the University

Students who have not completed their programmes of study may apply to transfer to another programme, and may be admitted, provided that the total period of registration will not exceed the normal duration of the original or new study programme, whichever is longer. Unless exceptionally approved by Academic Planning and Regulations Committee (APRC) Chairman, year one new students will only be considered for transfer to another programme offered in the same mode of study, starting from their second semester of registration.

Students who are currently on a UGC-funded programme and wish to transfer to another PolyU full-time UGC-funded programme of the same level should submit an application for transfer of study, instead of a new application in the non-JUPAS application period.

All applications for transfer of study will be considered in competition with other new applications.

# 8.4 Concurrent Enrolment

Students are not permitted to enrol concurrently on two full-time UGC-funded programmes, whether or not one of the programmes is offered by another institution.

In addition, students are not allowed to enrol concurrently on more than one programme (regardless of the mode of study), including those offered by another institution, without permission from the Head(s) of Department concerned, except for programmes which do not lead to any formal award.

# 8.5 Normal Duration for Completion of the Programme

Students should complete the programme within the normal duration of the programme as specified in the Programme Requirement Document. Those who exceed the normal duration of the programme will be de-registered from the programme unless prior approval has been obtained from relevant authorities. The study period of a student shall exclude deferment granted for justifiable reasons, and the semester(s) when the student has been approved to undertake internship. Any semester in which the students are allowed to take zero subject will be counted towards their total period of registration.

Students who have been registered for the normal duration of the programme may request extension of their studies for up to one year with the approval of the relevant Heads of Department/Deans of Independent School. Applications for extension of study period beyond one year and up to two years will require the approval from Faculty/School Board Chairman.

Students who have exceeded the normal duration of the programme for more than two years and have been de-registered can submit an appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee to request further extension. If the appeal fails, the student shall be de-registered.

To enable student sportsmen to manage their participation in trainings/competitions and academic studies, the normal duration for completion of programmes for students admitted via the OSRS will automatically be extended for two years. Further extension will follow the prevailing regulations.

# 8.6 Validity Period of Subject Credits

The validity period of subject credits earned is eight years from the year of attainment, i.e., the year in which the subject is completed. Credits earned from previous study should remain valid at the time when the student applies for credit transfer.

# 8.7 Residential Requirement

In order to be considered for a PolyU award, a student must complete at least 1/3 of the normal credit requirement for the award he/she is currently enrolled, unless the professional bodies concerned stipulate otherwise. This 1/3 requirement is also applicable to Minor programme and Secondary Major. Students must take at least 6 credits from their chosen Minor programme or at least 12 credits from their chosen Secondary Major in order to satisfy the residential requirement of their chosen Minor or Secondary Major.

# 8.8 Subject Registration and Withdrawal

In addition to programme registration, students need to register for the subjects at specified periods prior to the commencement of the semester. An add/drop period will also be scheduled for each semester/term. Students may apply for withdrawal of their registration on a subject after the add/drop period and before the commencement of the examination period if they have a genuine need to do so. The application should be made to the relevant programme offering Department and will require the approval of both the subject teacher and the host Department Programme Leader concerned. Applications submitted after the commencement of the examination period will not be considered. For approved applications of subject withdrawal, the tuition fee paid for the subject will be forfeited and the withdrawal status of the subject will be shown in the assessment result notification and transcript of studies, but will not be counted in the calculation of the GPA.

The pre-requisite requirements of a subject must have been fulfilled before a student registers for that subject. However, the subject offering Department has the discretion to waive the prerequisite requirements of a subject, if deemed appropriate. If the pre-requisite subject concerned forms part of the requirements for award, the subject has to be passed in order to satisfy the graduation requirements for the programme concerned, despite the waiving of the pre-requisite.

Subject to the maximum study load of 21 credits per semester and the availability of study places, students are allowed to take additional subjects on top of the prescribed credit

requirement for award before they become eligible for graduation. Students will be allowed to take additional subjects for broadening purpose, after they fulfil the graduation requirements and for the following semester. However, they will still be subject to the maximum study load of 21 credits per semester and the availability of places in the subjects concerned, and their enrolment will be arranged as subject-based students only and be subject to the rules on 'Admission of Subject-based Students', except that graduates from UGC-funded programmes will not be restricted to taking only subjects from a self-financed programme.

# 8.9 Study Load

For students following the progression pattern specified for their programme, they have to take the number of credits and subjects, as specified in this Programme Requirement Document, for each semester. Students cannot drop those subjects assigned by the department unless prior approval has been given by the department.

The normal study load is 15 credits in a semester for full-time study. The maximum study load to be taken by a student in a semester is 21 credits, unless exceptional approval is given by the Head of the programme offering department. For such cases, students should be reminded that the study load approved should not be taken as the grounds for academic appeal.

To help improve the academic performance of students on academic probation, these students will be required to take a reduced study load in the following semester (Summer Term excluded). The maximum number of credits to be taken by the students varies according to the policies of individual Departments and will be subject to the approval of the authorities concerned.

Students are not allowed to take zero subject in any semester, including the mandatory summer term as required by some programmes, unless they have obtained prior approval from the programme offering department; otherwise they will be classified as having unofficially withdrawn from their programme. Students who have been approved for zero subject enrolment (i.e., taking zero subject in a semester) are allowed to retain their student status and continue using campus facilities and library facilities. Any semester in which the students are allowed to take zero subject will nevertheless be counted towards the total period of registration.

Students who have obtained approval to pace their studies and students on programmes without any specified progression pattern who wish to take more than the normal load of 15 credits in a semester should seek advice from the Department concerned before the selection of subjects.

# 8.10 Subject Exemption

Students may be exempted from taking any specified subjects, including mandatory GUR subjects, if they have successfully completed similar subjects previously in another programme or have demonstrated the level of proficiency/ability to the satisfaction of the subject offering Department. Subject exemption is normally decided by the subject offering Department. However, for applications which are submitted by students who have completed an approved student exchange programme, the subject exemption is to be decided by the programme offering Department in consultation with the subject offering Departments. If students are exempted from taking a specified subject, the credits associated with the exempted subject will not be counted towards meeting the award requirements. It will therefore be necessary for the students to consult the programme offering Department and take another subject in order to satisfy the credit requirement for the award.

# 8.11 Credit Transfer

Students may be given credits for recognised previous studies including mandatory General University Requirements (GUR) subjects, and the credits will be counted towards meeting the requirements for award/degree. Transferred credits may not normally be counted towards more than one degree. The granting of credit transfer is a matter of academic judgment.

Credit transfer may be done with or without the grade being carried over; the former should normally be used when the credits were gained from PolyU. Credit transfer with the grade being carried over may be granted for subjects taken from outside the University, if deemed appropriate, and with due consideration to the academic equivalence of the subjects concerned and the comparability of the grading systems adopted by the University and the other approved institutions. Subject credit transfer is normally decided by the subject offering Department. However, for applications which are submitted by students who have completed an approved student exchange programme, the decision will be made by the programme offering Department in consultation with the subject offering Departments.

Normally, not more than  $50\%$  of the credit requirement for award may be transferable from approved institutions outside the University. For transfer of credits from programmes offered by PolyU, normally not more than  $67\%$  of the credit requirement for award can be transferred. In cases where both types of credits are being transferred (i.e. from programmes offered by PolyU and from approved institutions outside the University), not more than  $50\%$  of the credit requirement for award may be transferred. However, for students admitted to an Articulation Degree or Senior Year curriculum, which is already a reduced curriculum, they should not be given credit transfer for any required GUR subjects, and are required to complete at least 60 credits in order to be eligible for a Bachelor's award.

With applications for transfer of credits earned through study under an approved exchange programme, students should seek approval on their study plan and credit transferability from the programme offering Department before they start the exchange programme. In order to overcome possible problems associated with subject-to-subject mappings, block credit transfer rather than subject-by-subject credit transfer can be given.

All credit transfers approved will take effect in the semester for which they are approved. A student who applies for transfer of credits for a particular semester will only be eligible for graduation at the end of that semester (even if the granting of credit transfer will immediately enable the student to satisfy the credit requirement for the award).

For credit transfer of retained subjects, the grade attained in the last attempt should be taken in the case of credit transfer with grade being carried over. Students applying for credit transfer for a subject taken in other institutions are required to declare that the subject grade used for claiming credit transfer was attained in the last attempt of the subject in their previous studies. If a student fails in the last attempt of a retained subject, no credit transfer should be granted, despite the fact that the student may have attained a pass grade for the subject in the earlier attempts.

Students should not be granted credit transfer for a subject which they have attempted and failed in their current study unless the subject was taken by the student as an exchange-out student in his/her current programme.

# 8.12 Deferment of Study

Students may apply for deferment of study if they have a genuine need to do so such as illness or posting to work outside Hong Kong. Approval from the Department offering the programme is required. The deferment period will not be counted towards the total period of registration.

Application for deferment of study from students who have not yet completed the first year of a full-time programme will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.

Where the period of deferment of study begins during a stage for which fees have been paid, no refund of such fees will be made.

Students who have been approved for deferment are not entitled to enjoy any campus facilities during the deferment period.

# 8.13 General Assessment Regulations

Students progress by credit accumulation, i.e., credits earned by passing individual subjects can be accumulated and counted towards the final award.

A 'level' in a programme indicates the intellectual demand placed upon students and may characterise each subject with respect to its recommended sequencing within that programme. Upper level subjects should normally build on lower level subjects. Pre-requisite requirements, if any, must therefore be spelt out on a subject basis.

A 'subject' is defined as a discrete section of the programme which is assigned a separate assessment. A list of subjects, together with their level and weightings, shall be published in the Programme Requirement Document.

The language of assessment for all programmes/subjects shall be English, unless approval is given for it to be otherwise.

# 8.14 Principles of Assessment

Assessment of learning and assessment for learning are both important for assuring the quality of student learning. Assessment of learning is to evaluate whether students have achieved the intended learning outcomes of the subjects that they have taken and have attained the overall learning outcomes of the academic programme at the end of their study at a standard appropriate to the award. Appropriate methods of assessment that align with the intended learning outcomes should be designed for this purpose. The assessment methods will also enable the teacher to differentiate students' different levels of performance within the subject. Assessment for learning is to engage students in productive learning activities through purposefully designed assessment tasks.

Assessment will also serve as feedback to students. The assessment criteria and standards should be made explicit to students before the start of the assessment to facilitate student learning, and feedback provided should link to the criteria and standards. Timely feedback should be provided to students so that they are aware of their progress and attainment for the purpose of improvement.

The ultimate authority in the University for the confirmation of academic decisions is the Senate, but for practical reasons, the Senate has delegated to the Faculty/School Boards the authority to confirm the decisions of Boards of Examiners provided these are made within the framework of the General Assessment Regulations. Recommendations from Board of Examiners which fall outside these Regulations shall be ratified by the APRC and reported to the Senate as necessary.

# 8.15 Assessment Methods

Students' performance in a subject can be assessed by continuous assessment and/or examinations, at the discretion of the individual subject offering department. Where both continuous assessment and examinations are used, the weighting of each in the overall subject grade shall be clearly stated in the Programme Requirement Document. The subject offering department can decide whether students are required to pass both the continuous assessment and examination components, or either component only, in order to obtain a subject pass, but this requirement (to pass both, or either, components) shall be specified in the Programme Requirement Document. Learning outcome should be assessed by continuous assessment and/or examination appropriately, in line with the outcome-based approach.

Continuous assessment may include tests, assignments, projects, laboratory work, field exercises, presentations and other forms of classroom participation. Continuous Assessment assignments which involve group work should nevertheless include some individual components therein. The contribution made by each student in continuous assessment involving a group effort shall be determined and assessed separately, and this can result in different grades being awarded to students in the same group.

Assessment methods and parameters of subjects shall be determined by the subject offering department.

At the beginning of each semester, the subject teacher should inform students of the details of the methods of assessments to be used, within the assessment framework as specified in the Programme Requirement Document.

# 8.16 Progression / Academic Probation / Deregistration

The Board of Examiners shall, at the end of each semester (except for Summer Term unless there are students who are eligible to graduate after completion of Summer Term subjects or the Summer Term study is mandatory for the programme), determine whether each student is

(i) eligible for progression towards an award; or  
(ii) eligible for an award; or  
(iii) required to be deregistered from the programme.

When a student has a Grade Point Average (GPA) lower than 1.70, he/she will be put on academic probation in the following semester. If a student is able to pull his/her GPA up to 1.70 or above at the end of the semester, the status of "academic probation" will be lifted. The status of "academic probation" will be reflected in the assessment result notification but not in the transcript of studies.

A student will have 'progressing' status unless he/she falls within any one of the following categories, which may be regarded as grounds for deregistration from the programme:

(i) the student has reached the final year of the normal period of registration for that programme, as specified in the Programme Requirement Document, unless approval has been given for extension; or  
(ii) the student has reached the maximum number of retakes allowed for a failed compulsory subject; or  
(iii) the student's GPA is lower than 1.70 for two consecutive semesters and his/her Semester GPA in the second semester is also lower than 1.70; or  
(iv) the student's GPA is lower than 1.70 for three consecutive semesters.

When a student falls within any of the categories as stipulated above, except for category (i) with approval for extension, the Board of Examiners shall de-register the student from the programme without exception.

A student may be de-registered from the programme enrolled before the time frame specified at (iii) or (iv) above if his/her academic performance is poor to the extent that the Board of Examiners deems that his/her chance of attaining a GPA of 1.70 at the end of the programme is slim or impossible.

The progression of students to the following academic year will not be affected by the GPA obtained in the Summer Term, unless Summer Term study is mandatory for all students of the programme and constitutes a requirement for graduation, and is so specified in the Programme Requirement Document.

If the student is not satisfied with the de-registration decision of the Board of Examiners, he/she can lodge an appeal. All such appeal cases will be referred directly to Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) for final decision. Views of Faculties/Schools/Departments will be sought and made available to AAC for reference.

# 8.17 Retaking of Subjects

Students may only retake a subject which they have failed (i.e. Grade F or S or U). Retaking of subjects is with the condition that the maximum study load of 21 credits per semester is not exceeded.

The number of retakes of a subject should be restricted to two, i.e., a maximum of three attempts for each subject is allowed.

In cases where a student takes another subject to replace a failed elective subject, the fail grade will be taken into account in the calculation of the GPA, despite the passing of the replacement subject. Likewise, students who fail a Cluster Area Requirement (CAR) subject may need to take another subject from the same Cluster Area in order to fulfill this part of the GUR, since the original CAR subject may not be offered; in such cases, the fail grade for the first CAR subject will be taken into account in the calculation of the GPA, despite the passing of the second CAR subject. Note

Students need to submit a request to the Faculty/School Board for the second retake of a failed subject.

Students who have failed a compulsory subject after two retakes and have been de-registered can submit an appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) for a third chance of retaking the subject.

In case AAC does not approve further retakes of a failed compulsory subject or the taking of an equivalent subject with special approval from the Faculty, the student concerned would be de-registered and the decision of the AAC shall be final within the University.

Note: In these circumstances when students do not have a choice to retake a failed subject, such as when the failed subject has been phased out, a 'tie-subject' arrangement can be made with the approval of the Faculty Board. Under the arrangement, another appropriate subject can be taken as equivalent to the subject which is not offered. Upon passing the equivalent subject, the fail grade of the original subject will be replaced by the latest grade of the retake subject and the failure grade of the original subject will not be taken into account in the calculation of the GPA.

# 8.18 Absence from an assessment component

If a student is unable to complete all the assessment components of a subject, due to illness or other circumstances which are beyond his/her control and considered by the subject offering Department as legitimate, the Department will determine whether the student will have to complete a late assessment and, if so, by what means. This late assessment shall take place at the earliest opportunity, and normally before the commencement of the following academic year (except that for Summer Term, which may take place within 3 weeks after the finalisation of Summer Term results). If the late assessment cannot be completed before the commencement of the following academic year, the Faculty/School Board Chairman shall decide on an appropriate time for completion of the late assessment.

The student concerned is required to submit his/her application for late assessment in writing to the Head of Department offering the subject, within five working days from the date of the examination, together with any original supporting documents. Approval of applications for late assessment and the means for such late assessments shall be given by the Head of Department offering the subject or the subject teacher concerned, in consultation with the Programme Leader. Verification of the supporting documents with the issuing authority may be conducted by the subject offering Department as part of the approval process.

# 8.19 Aegrotat Award

If a student is unable to complete the requirements of the programme in question for the award due to very serious illness, or other very special circumstances which are beyond his/her control, and considered by the Board of Examiners as legitimate, the Faculty/School Board will determine whether the student will be granted an aegrotat award. Aegrotat award will be granted under very exceptional circumstances.

A student who has been offered an aegrotat award shall have the right to opt either to accept such an award, or request to be assessed on another occasion to be stipulated by the Board of Examiners; the student's exercise of this option shall be irrevocable.

The acceptance of an aegrotat award by a student shall disqualify him from any subsequent assessment for the same award.

An aegrotat award shall normally not be classified, and the award parchment shall not state that it is an aegrotat award. However, the Board of Examiners may determine whether the award should be classified, provided that they have adequate information on the students' academic performance.

# 8.20 Grading

Assessment grades shall be awarded on a criterion-referenced basis. A student's overall performance in a subject shall be graded as follows from 2020/21 onwards:

<table><tr><td>Subject grade</td><td>Short description</td><td>Elaboration on subject grading description</td></tr><tr><td>A+</td><td rowspan="3">Excellent</td><td rowspan="3">Demonstrates excellent achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to skillfully use concepts and solve complex problems. Shows evidence of innovative and critical thinking in unfamiliar situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>B+</td><td rowspan="3">Good</td><td rowspan="3">Demonstrates good achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to use appropriate concepts and solve problems. Shows the ability to analyse issues critically and make well-grounded judgements in familiar or standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner.</td></tr><tr><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td rowspan="3">Satisfactory</td><td rowspan="3">Demonstrates satisfactory achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Shows some capacity for analysis and making judgements in a variety of familiar and standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a manner that is generally logical but fragmented.</td></tr><tr><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>C-</td></tr><tr><td>D+</td><td rowspan="3">Pass</td><td rowspan="3">Demonstrates marginal achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Can make basic comparisons, connections and judgments and express the ideas learnt in the subject, though there are frequent breakdowns in logic and clarity.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>Fail</td><td>Demonstrates inadequate achievement of intended subject learning outcomes through a lack of knowledge and/or understanding of the subject matter. Evidence of analysis is often irrelevant or incomplete.</td></tr></table>

'F' is a subject failure grade, whilst all others ('D' to 'A+') are subject passing grades. No credit will be earned if a subject is failed.

Indicative descriptors for modifier grades

<table><tr><td>Main Grade (solid)</td><td>The student generally performed at this level, indicating mastery of the subject intended learning outcomes at this level.</td></tr><tr><td>+ (exemplary)</td><td>The student consistently performed at this level and exceeded the expectations of this level in some regards, but not enough to claim mastery at the next level.</td></tr><tr><td>- (marginal)</td><td>The student basically performed at this level, but the performance was inconsistent or fell slightly short in some regards.</td></tr></table>

Note: The above indicative descriptors for modifier grades are not applicable to the pass grades D and D+

A numeral grade point is assigned to each subject grade. The grade points assigned to subject grades attained by students from 2020/21 are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Grade</td><td>Grade Point for grades attained</td></tr><tr><td>A+</td><td>4.3</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>A-</td><td>3.7</td></tr><tr><td>B+</td><td>3.3</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>2.7</td></tr><tr><td>C+</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>C-</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>D+</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>0.0</td></tr></table>

At the end of each semester/term, a Grade Point Average (GPA) will be computed as follows, and based on the grade point of all the subjects:

$$
G P A = \frac {\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \text {S u b j e c t G r a d e P o i n t} _ {n} \times \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {n}}{\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {n}}
$$

where  $\mathrm{N} =$  number of all subjects (inclusive of failed subjects) taken by the student up to and including the latest semester/term. For subjects which have been retaken, only the grade point obtained in the final attempt will be included in the GPA calculation

In addition, the following subjects will be excluded from the GPA calculation:

(i) Exempted subjects  
(ii) Ungraded subjects  
(iii) Incomplete subjects  
(iv) Subjects for which credit transfer has been approved, but without any grade assigned  
(v) Subjects from which a student has been allowed to withdraw (i.e., those with the code 'W')

Subject which has been given an "S" code, i.e., absent from all assessment components, will be included in the GPA calculation and will be counted as "zero" grade point. GPA is thus the unweighted cumulative average calculated for a student, for all relevant subjects taken from the start of the programme to a particular point of time. GPA is an indicator of overall performance, and ranges from 0.00 to 4.30 from 2020/21.

All training credits will be counted in the GPA calculation but not in the WGPA calculation.

# 8.21 Different types of GPA

GPA's will be calculated for each Semester including the Summer Term. This Semester GPA will be used to determine students' eligibility to progress to the next Semester alongside with the 'cumulative GPA'. However, the Semester GPA calculated for the Summer Term will not be used for this purpose, unless the Summer Term study is mandatory for all students of the programme concerned and constitutes part of the graduation requirements.

The GPA calculated after the second Semester of the students' study is therefore a 'cumulative' GPA of all the subjects taken so far by students, and without applying any level weighting.

Along with the 'cumulative' GPA, a weighted GPA will also be calculated, to give an indication to the Board of Examiners on the award classification which a student will likely get if he/she makes steady progress on his/her academic studies.

When a student has satisfied the requirements for award, an award GPA will be calculated to determine his/her award classification.

For students taking the Major/Minor study route, a separate GPA will be calculated for their Major and Minor programmes. The Major GPA will be used to determine their award classification, which will be so reflected on the award parchment. The Minor GPA can be used as a reference for Board of Examiners to moderate the award classification for the Major.

For students taking the Major/Secondary Major study route, there is no separate "Secondary Major GPA". The Major GPA is the weighted GPA of all subjects contributing to the Major and Secondary Major.

The calculation methods of the different types of GPA are further explained in the table below.

<table><tr><td>Types of GPA</td><td>Purpose</td><td>Rules for GPA calculation</td></tr><tr><td>GPA</td><td>Determine Progression/ Graduation</td><td>(1) All academic subjects taken by the student throughout his/her study, both inside and outside the programme curriculum, are included in the GPA calculation.
(2) For training subjects, including WIE and Clinical/Field subjects, departments can decide whether to include them in the GPA calculation.
(3) For retake subjects, only the last attempt will be taken in the GPA calculation.
(4) Level weighting, if any, will be ignored.</td></tr><tr><td>Semester GPA</td><td>Determine Progression</td><td>Similar to the rules for GPA as described above, except that only subjects taken in that Semester, including retaken subjects, will be included in the calculation.</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted GPA</td><td>To give an interim indication on the likely Award GPA</td><td>(1) Similar to the rules for GPA, except that only subjects inside the programme curriculum concerned will be included in the calculation. Subjects outside the programme curriculum will be excluded.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>(2) Departments can decide whether the training subjects are to be counted towards the Weighted GPA.
(3) For retake subjects, only the last attempt will be taken in the Weighted GPA calculation.
(4) A weighting of 2 for Level 1 and 2 subjects, and a weighting of 3 for Level 3 and above, will be included in the calculation to determine the Honours classifications for Bachelor's degree programmes.
(5) The weighted GPA will be the same as the Award GPA unless a student has taken more subjects than required.</td></tr><tr><td>Major/Minor GPA</td><td>For reference and determination of award classification</td><td>Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) /Minor GPA
(1) Only subjects inside the curriculum of the Major/Minor Programmes will be taken in the Major/Minor GPA calculation.
(2) Departments can decide whether the training subjects, are to be counted towards the Major/Minor GPA.
(3) For retake subjects, only the last attempt will be taken in the Major/Minor GPA calculation.
(4) Up to 6 credits from the Major/GUR [including Language Communication Requirements (LCR) subjects at proficiency level] can be counted towards the chosen Minor. Nevertheless, students must take at least 6 credits from their chosen Minor programme in order to satisfy the residential requirement of their chosen Minor. In addition, to be eligible for the Major and Minor awards, the total number of credits taken by the students for their Major-Minor studies must not be lower than the credit requirement of the single discipline Major programme.
Major GPA
Level weighting will be included in the calculation of Major GPA.
Minor GPA
Level weighting will not be included in the calculation of Minor GPA.</td></tr><tr><td>Award GPA</td><td>For determination of award classification</td><td>If the student has not taken more subjects than required, the Award GPA will be as follows:
(1) For single Major:
Award GPA = Weighted GPA
(2) For Major/Minor programmes:
Award GPA = Major GPA
(3) For programmes without level weighting:
Award GPA = GPA
If the student has taken more subjects than required, refer to Section 8.23 below.</td></tr></table>

# 8.22 Guidelines for Award Classification

The Weighted GPA will be used as a guide to help determine award classifications.

Weighted GPA will be computed as follows:

$$
\text {W e i g h t e d G P A} = \frac {\sum_ {\mathrm {n} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \text {S u b j e c t G r a d e P o i n t} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times \mathrm {W} _ {\mathrm {n}}}{\sum_ {\mathrm {n} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times \mathrm {W} _ {\mathrm {n}}}
$$

where  $W_{n} =$  weighting to be assigned according to the level of the subject

$\mathbf{N} =$  number of all subjects counted in GPA calculation

For calculating the weighted GPA (and award GPA) to determine the Honours classification of students who satisfy the graduation requirements of Bachelor's degree awards, a University-wide standard weighting will be applied to all subjects of the same level, with a weighting of  $\underline{2}$  for Level 1 and 2 subjects and a weighting of  $\underline{3}$  for Level 3 and above subjects. Same as for GPA, Weighted GPA ranges from 0.00 to 4.30 from 2020/21.

Any subjects passed after the graduation requirement has been met or subjects taken on top of the prescribed credit requirements for award shall not be taken into account in the grade point calculation for award classification. However, if a student attempts more elective subjects (or optional subjects) than those required for graduation in or before the semester in which he/she becomes eligible for award, the elective subjects (or optional subjects), except for subjects which are selected by students to fulfill the free electives requirement for graduation, with a higher grade/contribution shall be included in the grade point calculation (i.e., the excessive subjects attempted with a lower grade/contribution, including failed subjects, will be excluded).

For students who have completed a Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option)/Minor programme, a single classification will be awarded and their award classification will mainly be based on the "Major GPA", but it can be moderated by the Board of Examiners with reference to the "Minor GPA". For students who have completed a Major programme combined with free electives, their award classification will be determined by their "Major GPA" which includes grades obtained for the free electives, if appropriate.

"Major GPA" is derived based on all subjects of the Major programme, as well as the Secondary Major programme, if any, including those meeting the mandatory General University Requirements (GUR) and programme-specific language requirement, but not necessarily including the training credits.

"Minor GPA" is derived based on the 18 credits of specific Minor programme. "Minor GPA" is unweighted.

The "Major GPA" and the "Minor GPA" will be presented separately to the Board of Examiners for consideration. The guidelines for determining award classification are applicable to programmes with Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option)/Minor studies.

Where a student has a high GPA for his/her Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) but a lower GPA for his/her Minor, he/she will not be 'penalised' in respect of his/her award classification, which is attached to the Major. On the other hand, if a student has a lower GPA for his/her Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) than his/her GPA for the Minor, the Board of Examiners may consider recommending a higher award classification for the student for ratification by the APRC via the Faculty/School Board.

# 8.23 Classification of Awards

For Honours degree programmes, the awards will be classified as follows:

First Class Honours  
Second Class Honours (Division 1)  
Second Class Honours (Division 2)  
Third Class Honours

The following are guidelines for Boards of Examiners' reference in determining award classifications:

<table><tr><td>Honours 
Degrees</td><td>Guidelines</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>The student&#x27;s performance/attainment is outstanding, and identifies him/her as exceptionally able in the field covered by the programme in question.</td></tr><tr><td>2:i</td><td>The student has reached a standard of performance/attainment which is more than satisfactory but less than outstanding.</td></tr><tr><td>2:ii</td><td>The student has reached a standard of performance/attainment judged to be satisfactory, and clearly higher than the &#x27;essential minimum&#x27; required for graduation.</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>The student has attained the ‘essential minimum’ required for graduation at a standard ranging from just adequate to just satisfactory.</td></tr></table>

Under exceptional circumstances, a student who has completed an Honours degree programme, but has not attained Honours standard, may be awarded a Pass-without-Honours degree. A Pass-without-Honours degree award will be recommended, when the student has demonstrated a level of final attainment which is below the 'essential minimum' required for graduation with Honours from the programme in question, but when he/she has nonetheless covered the prescribed work of the programme in an adequate fashion, while failing to show sufficient evidence of the intellectual calibre expected of Honours degree graduates. For example, if a student in an Honours degree programme has a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 1.70 or more, but his/her Weighted GPA is less than 1.70, he/she may be considered for a Pass-without-Honours classification. A Pass-without-Honours is an unclassified award, but the award parchment will not include this specification.

Students who have committed academic dishonesty or non-compliance with examination regulations will be subject to the penalty of the lowering of award classification by one level. For undergraduate students who should be awarded a Third class Honours degree, they will be downgraded to a Pass-without-Honours. The minimum of downgraded overall result will be kept at a Pass.

The followings are the award GPA ranges for determining award classifications:

<table><tr><td>Honours Degrees</td><td>Award GPA</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>3.60 – 4.30</td></tr><tr><td>2:i</td><td>3.00 – 3.59</td></tr><tr><td>2:ii</td><td>2.40 – 2.99</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>1.70 – 2.39</td></tr></table>

Decisions by the Boards of Examiners on award classifications to be granted to each student on completion of the programme shall be ratified by the Faculty/School Board (of Examiners). For cases the decisions of which do not conform to the above indicative GPA range, they should be referred, by the Faculty/School Board (of Examiners), to the APRC for ratification.

# 8.24 Examination result announcements, transcripts, testimonials and references

At the end of each semester, where appropriate, examination results are announced online for individual students' checking. It provides information on subjects taken and grades attained, the Grade Point Average (GPA) for all subjects, and the overall result up to and including the latest semester. The announcement serves as an official notification of the student's academic performance.

A formal Transcript of Studies will be issued by the University, upon request, to any student registered on a programme offered by the University, and it will include the following information:

(i) name and student number;  
(ii) title of the programme(s) on which enrolled, or from which graduated;  
(iii) medium of instruction for the programme (applicable only to programmes which are delivered in Chinese and for which both Chinese and English versions are offered);  
(iv) a full academic record, giving subjects taken and grades attained, and the Grade Point Average (GPA) for all subjects (this shall include any practical training undertaken, which fulfill the training credit requirement of the programme concerned);  
(v) credit requirement of the student if different from the normal credit requirement of the programme;  
(vi) where relevant, the final award(s) (including information on the Secondary Major and/or Minor award, if appropriate), with classification and year of award;  
(vii) a statement indicating that the student has completed the Work-integrated Education (WIE) activities / Healthy Lifestyle / e-learning course in Putonghua (offered as an option with effect from the 2018/19 intake cohort), as appropriate; and  
(viii) information on the partner institution, if the award is for a dual degree/joint programme with another institution and leads to a dual/joint award.

Students may request for a testimonial which is a certification of their studies at the University, but without details on subjects and subject results.

Students may also request for references direct from academic staff members concerned.

# 8.25 Recording of disciplinary actions in students' records

With effect from Semester One of 2015/16, disciplinary actions against students' misconducts will be recorded in students' records.

Students who are found guilty of academic dishonesty or non-compliance with examination regulations will be subject to the penalty of having the subject result concerned disqualified and be given a failure grade with a remark denoting 'Disqualification of result due to academic dishonesty/noncompliance with examination regulations'. The remark will be shown in the students' record as well as the assessment result notification and transcript of studies, until their leaving the University.

Students who have committed disciplinary offences (covering both academic and non-academic related matters) will be put on 'disciplinary probation'. The status of 'disciplinary probation' will be shown in the students' record as well as the assessment result notification, transcript of studies and testimonial during the probation period, until their leaving the University. The disciplinary probation is normally one year unless otherwise decided by the Student Discipline Committee.

The University reserves the right to withhold the issuance of any certificate of study to a student/graduand who has unsettled matters with the University, or subject to is disciplinary action.

# 1 Rationale for AIDA

Data has been characterised as the new oil; it is valuable only if it can be refined into a form that drives profitable and productive activity. Artificial intelligence and data analytics (AIDA) are undoubtedly the most prevailing technologies to carry out such a refinement process and are the most important driving forces in our data-driven society today. Through the rapid technological developments of the 21st Century, big data has become available, and with remarkable success in the past decade. AIDA is thus becoming a de-facto standard approach to enrich business, advance technology and achieve breakthroughs in virtually all fields. Therefore, it is essential for students to possess expertise in AIDA and other underpinning technologies.

PolyU is fully aware of the opportunities and challenges brought about by the new economy and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and believes that it is indispensable for the next generation of workforce to possess expertise in AIDA and other underpinning technologies such as robotics, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and blockchain, to name a few.

# 2 Aims and Objectives for AIDA

The AIDA Secondary Major is designed in response to the rapidly developing fields of artificial intelligence and data analytics that are currently gaining unprecedented traction in industry as well as generating demand for qualified professionals in the job market. By integrating within the major discipline of the student, this secondary major aims to produce the next generation of graduates skilled with AI computational thinking and data analytics acumen in their chosen discipline to meet the needs of society, help improve efficiencies and augment human capabilities.

This secondary major comprises interdisciplinary and integrated programmes to equip students with a strong foundation in computer science, statistics and mathematics, so as to nurture them to make use of AIDA techniques to solve contemporary problems in a discipline of their choice.

Each academic programme offering the option of this secondary major will incorporate a block of AIDA subjects (such as programming, mathematics, statistics, big data, AI and machine learning) into the study of the academic programme focusing on a particular discipline or domain. Students will complete their study within the normal programme duration and graduate with their respective bachelor's degree, equipped with technical skills related to AIDA, coupled with the domain knowledge from a block of subjects either specially designed, or chosen from the corresponding academic programme, in addition to the GUR subjects. An Integrated Capstone Project (ICP) will be included, with the aim of developing the capabilities of a student in analysing and solving complex and potential real-life problems, as well as training them in skills related to systematic development and documentation of a significant piece of work.

# 3 Programme's Intended Learning Outcomes (PILOs)

On successful completion of this secondary major in AIDA, students will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamentals of AIDA, and have the ability to apply them.  
2. Design AIDA systems, components and processes to meet given specifications and constraints.  
3. Identify, formulate and solve problems relevant to AIDA.  
4. Use modern IT tools appropriate to AIDA practice.  
5. Know the contemporary issues, and understand the impact of AIDA solutions in a global and societal context.

# 4 Selection Mechanism

Studying a Secondary Major is a free choice by students and not mandatory. Only students with a Cumulative GPA of 2.70 or above may be considered for Secondary Major enrolment. Students must apply to and obtain approval from their programme offering Department, no later than the commencement of the second year of study, to be admitted to the Secondary Major.

The departments reserve the right to revise and update the syllabi whenever appropriate and deemed necessary.

# 7 Award Classification

For students who have completed a Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option)/Minor programme, a single classification will be awarded and their award classification will mainly be based on the "Major GPA", but it can be moderated by the Board of Examiners with reference to the "Minor GPA". For students who have completed a Major programme combined with free electives, their award classification will be determined by their "Major GPA" which includes grades obtained for the free electives, if appropriate.

"Major GPA" is derived based on all subjects of the Major programme, as well as the Secondary Major programme, if any, including those meeting the mandatory General University Requirements (GUR) and programme-specific language requirement, but not necessarily including the training credits.

"Minor GPA" is derived based on the 18 credits of specific Minor programme. "Minor GPA" is unweighted.

The "Major GPA" and the "Minor GPA" will be presented separately to the Board of Examiners for consideration. The guidelines for determining award classification are applicable to programmes with Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option)/Minor studies.

Where a student has a high GPA for his/her Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) but a lower GPA for his/her Minor, he/she will not be 'penalised' in respect of his/her award classification, which is attached to the Major. On the other hand, if a student has a lower GPA for his/her Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) than his/her GPA for the Minor, the Board of Examiners may consider recommending a higher award classification for the student for ratification by the APRC via the Faculty/School Board.
