## 3 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering > 3.1 Programme Aims and Rationale (Part 1)

The programme aims to provide the students with a sound education in electrical engineering and furnish an opportunity for detailed study in a choice of related specialist areas. The programme is designed to nurture electrical engineers who will be able to practise their profession worldwide while being particularly competent to do so in the context of Hong Kong and Mainland China.

Modern engineers are often required to undertake different activities and may face promotion or placement in the course of their career development. The programme thus aims to prepare graduates for their entire working life rather than only for their first jobs. Emphasis is therefore placed on the understanding of fundamental concepts and theories which will always be applicable and valid. The teaching of technologies or modern tools which may have a shorter duration of applicability cannot be neglected either, but it is important not to emphasise training at the expense of education.

More and more industrial employers wish to recruit engineers who have a broad-based education as well as adequate professional knowledge to undertake detailed technical work in design and production. Therefore, the programme is also designed to provide training to our students who could develop a thorough understanding of electrical engineering, and acquire a broad and general appreciation of activities in other related disciplines. The students are guided to learn the interfaces between specialist engineering areas and be prepared to work in a multidisciplinary work environment which usually involves colleagues from other engineering backgrounds.

## 3 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering > 3.1 Programme Aims and Rationale (Part 2)
Students should aware that 'a good engineering solution' is one which has to fulfil economic, financial, and social criteria as well as to comply with engineering design specifications. This necessitates the inclusion of the study of economics, accounting and management with particular reference to engineering activities, as well as the inter-relations between engineering activities and society as a whole.

Language competence of students is strengthened through the English and Chinese subjects stipulated in the General University Requirements (GUR), and is further enhanced by Major subjects. The teaching approach adopted in the curriculum, which involves lectures, seminars, discussions, in-class feedback, assessed presentations, demonstration of project work and written laboratory reports, aims to improve students' verbal and written communication skills.

It is important to train and educate our students not only in cognitive ability in technical areas but also lifelong skills. Hence, students are exposed to situations where they can:

(i) develop their intellectual abilities (creative thinking, critical/independent judgement making, ability to analyse and synthesize, and to cope with real-life conditions such as indeterminacy, lack of information and time pressure); and  
(ii) develop their social abilities (ethics, personal and public relations, team work, responsibility/authority, etc.).

In this undergraduate programme, the fundamentals of science and engineering are taught in Year 1 and Year 2. Core subjects are covered in Year 3 while advanced ones are in Year 4. Students are provided with training at the Industrial Centre (IC) so that they learn the applications of engineering technologies. They are also required to undertake industrial placement during the summer at the end of the third year of study, which gives them exposure to the real industrial working environment.

## 3 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering > 3.2 Programme Objectives

(i) To provide students with a broad base of knowledge in the fundamentals of electrical engineering and its current applications.  
(ii) To prepare students for working life including the skills needed for lifelong learning.  
(iii) To produce engineers with the understanding of their obligations to society.

## 3 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical Engineering > 3.3 Programme Outcomes (Part 1)

Programme outcomes refer to the intellectual abilities, knowledge, skills and attributes that a graduate from this programme should possess. To attain the aim of developing all-round students, the programme outcome statements are encompassed in the following learning outcomes.

Upon successful completion of the programme, students will be able to:

1. Apply fundamental principles of mathematics, science and engineering to identify, formulate and solve practical problems in electrical engineering and related fields.

## 4 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Transportation Systems Engineering > 4.1 Programme Aims and Rationale (Part 1)

In the programme, the students are to acquire a solid understanding of the fundamentals in electrical engineering and apply their knowledge and techniques on the relevant areas in transportation. The philosophy of the programme focuses on incorporating the appropriate engineering knowledge into transportation systems in order to enhance the efficiency, reliability, safety and sustainability of the system infrastructure and services. The current practices in transportation industries, the latest technologies in transportation systems; and hence their integration to provide engineering solutions for practical problems constitutes the main contents of this programme.

Education is important to equip students with knowledge and skills for developing their long-term careers. Emphasis is, therefore, placed on the understanding of fundamental concepts which will always be applicable and valid. Particular techniques which may have a shorter duration of applicability, however, cannot be neglected. Applications change rapidly as technology evolves but the underlying theories remain.

Transportation always involves multi-disciplinary knowledge and techniques. The students are guided to learn the interfaces between specialist engineering areas and be prepared to work in a multidisciplinary work environment which usually involves colleagues from other engineering backgrounds. On the other hand, the students should aware that 'a good engineering solution' is one which fulfils economic and financial criteria as well as the engineering design specifications. This necessitates the inclusion of the study of finance, accounting, management and ethical and social responsibilities with particular reference to transportation systems engineering activities, as well as the inter-relations between such activities and the society as a whole.

## 4 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Transportation Systems Engineering > 4.1 Programme Aims and Rationale (Part 2)
Language competence of students is strengthened through the English and Chinese subjects stipulated in the General University Requirements (GUR), and is further enhanced by Major subjects.

## 5 Curriculum > 5.1 Summary of University Graduation Requirements (Part 2)
There are subjects which are designed to fulfil the credit requirement of different types of subjects. Students passing these subjects will be regarded as having fulfilled the credit requirements of the particular types of subjects concerned. Nevertheless, the subject passed will only be counted once in fulfilling the credit requirements of the award, and the students will be required to take another subject in order to meet the total credit requirement of the programme concerned.

Level-0 subjects and training subjects (including clinical/field training) will not be counted to fulfill free elective requirement for graduation purpose.

Senior Year intakes admitted to the 4-year Undergraduate Degree programmes on the strength of the Associate Degree/Higher Diploma qualifications are required to complete at least 60 credits in order to be eligible for a Bachelor's degree. Exemption may be given for subjects already taken in the previous Associate Degree/Higher Diploma studies. In that case, students should take other electives (including free electives) instead to make up the total of 60 credits required.

A student is required to graduate as soon as he/she satisfies the graduation requirements as stipulated above. The student concerned is required to apply for graduation, in the semester in which he/she is able to fulfil all his/her graduation requirements, and after the add/drop period for that semester has ended.

Students taking the Major/Minor option

## 5 Curriculum > 5.1 Summary of University Graduation Requirements (Part 3)
Students taking the Major/Minor option will be considered for an award when they have satisfied the requirements for both the Major and Minor studies (i.e., having a GPA of 1.70 or above) and have also submitted an application for graduation. If the 18 credits taken for the approved Minor study can meet the requirements for that Minor, the Major students may apply to graduate with a specific Minor, in addition to their Major. Otherwise, students will graduate with a Major only.

Table 5.7.2 Alignment of Subjects with Programme Intended Learning Outcomes

## 5 Curriculum > 5.8 Work-Integrated Education and Industrial Placement (Part 1)

Work-Integrated Education (WIE) is defined as a structured and measurable learning experience which takes place in an organisational context relevant to a student's future profession. It aims to prepare students for the realities of workplaces, develop students' ability to learn in non-academic surroundings, allow students to assess their own strengths and weaknesses in a realistic working settings and develop students' critical thinking and problem solving capabilities.

Industrial Placement (EEE3012) normally takes place during the summer at the end of Year Three. Students are expected to complete a minimum of 6 weeks of full-time (or equivalent) industrial training (3 training credits), of which is valid for WIE activities as recognised by the University.

WIE activities may include placement, employment or attachment relevant to the context, knowledge and skills of the Programme. The Job Board arranged by the Student Affairs Office (SAO) of the University is one of the main sources of placement opportunities for local students and students from Mainland China and overseas. The WIE activities may or may not involve any payment. Any payment by employers is completely at the employers' discretion. Typical examples of WIE activities are as follows:

## 5 Curriculum > 5.8 Work-Integrated Education and Industrial Placement (Part 2)
Full-time placement in a suitable organisation for 6 weeks.  
Assisting in PolyU activities that have an external collaboration or service component, such as Innovation and Technology Fund projects, Rapid Product Development Syndicate projects, Industrial Guided Applied Research and Development projects, high-level consultancy projects, collaborative research projects undertaken with external organisations, and jobs undertaken by the Industrial Centre as a service for an external organisation.  
- Placement within the IAESTE (International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience) Programme, in which the student is attached to a workplace abroad during training.  
Students work on their final-year degree project, which involves an industrial partner or external client. The student need not be placed in the company, but will make frequent visits to ensure the project meets with the specifications required by the company.

To ensure students gain valuable experience, the industrial training must be carefully selected and well-organized. Prior to starting their placement, students must outline the expected learning outcomes and, upon completion, submit a report detailing their learning outcomes and achievements. Consequently, the following learning support activities will be conducted.

(i) Orientation

Students should begin their preparatory work at the start of the second semester, typically in their third-year of study. An orientation will be provided covering the following:

Basic skills in undertaking practical training  
- Planning and scheduling for successful completion of assessment tasks  
Information on searching local or non-local work-base employment and attachments

(ii) Progress Monitoring

During the training period, students should maintain a training journal to document their progress. The journal may include:

## 5 Curriculum > 5.8 Work-Integrated Education and Industrial Placement (Part 3)
- Location and title of the internship: Summarise where practical training took place and how the internship fits into the overall structure of the host organization.  
- Responsibilities: Describe the actual responsibilities undertaken during the internship.  
Skills and Knowledge: Detail the skills and knowledge required to fulfill the work responsibilities. Explain how these skills and knowledge evolved throughout the work experiences and their relevance to the academic studies and future goals.  
- **Outcome:** Describe the placement experiences and major achievements with concrete examples.

(iii) Learning Evaluation

Upon completing their practical training, students are required to submit a report about their work experience. It provides an opportunity for the student to reflect upon the learning gained at the work site. The framework of the report includes:

A summary of the report.  
- Detail description of activities carried out during the placement, minimum 6 pages.  
- A self-reflection: students articulate their thinking about each piece in the report, as well as on the entire report. Through this process of reflection, students draw connections between work experience and university-based learning, construct new knowledge, and become increasingly aware of themselves as learners.  
Conclusion: after reflection on their workplace experience, students set goals and directions for future learning.

## 5 Curriculum > 5.9 Industrial Centre (IC) Training

Besides the WIE training components, students are required to undertake training at the Industrial Centre (IC), which is equivalent to 8 training credits. The training is scheduled within Year One and at the end of Year Two. Students will not pay any training fee, nor receive any stipend. IC training is however not part of WIE activities

## 5 Curriculum > 5.10 Language Enhancement Subjects

All students are strongly encouraged to make full use of the facilities and services provided in the ELC and CLC to improve their language proficiency throughout the programme.

## 5 Curriculum > 5.11 Physics Enhancement Subject

Students who do not possess the requisite background knowledge in Physics (i.e., attained Level 2 in HKDSE Physics or Combined Science with a component in Physics) are required to take and pass a Physics enhancement subject (Introduction to Physics) before they can take Physics I and Physics II.

## 6 Management and Operation > 6.1 Administration

The daily operation of the programme, such as general administration of admission, registrations, student records, preparation for Board of Examiners meetings and documentations, is overseen by the Scheme/Programme Leader and the administrative team of the Department. All enquiries regarding registration and general administration from students on the programme should be made to the General Office as the first contact point.

The Departmental Programmes Committee (DPC), in which the Head of Department and the Scheme/Programme Leaders of all programmes offered by the Department are members, discusses and reviews the programme structure, syllabi content, high-level integration and future directions of the programme. The Departmental Learning and Teaching Committee (DLTC) advises on matters related to teaching methods and learning quality and cultivates the positive mentality toward teaching and learning among teaching staff and students. WIE/Career Liaison Officer and Student-Exchange Coordinator are appointed by the Department to provide students with advice and assistance.

## 6 Management and Operation > 6.2 Student-Staff Consultative Group (SSCG)

The Student-Staff Consultative Group consists of Student Representatives together with the Scheme/Programme Leader. The Committee is normally chaired by the Scheme/Programme Leader and meets at least twice a year. Issues to be kept under consideration include: student workload, teaching methods, balance between subject areas, training matters and other areas of mutual concern.

## 6 Management and Operation > 6.3 Academic Advising

While the Scheme/Programme Leader is available for the operation of the programme, general enquiries and counselling, Academic Advisors are in place to offer more personal contacts and to look after students' needs.

The Academic Advisors, usually an academic staff member, is assigned to each newly admitted student and he/she will be with the students till graduation. Academic Advisors provide continuous and individual counselling and help guide the students through various difficulties, if any, which might affect their studies. A specific staff member from the General Office will work closely with the Scheme/Programme Leaders and the Academic Advisors. All academic requirements and regulations related to academic programmes offered by the department as well as the GUR requirements will be provided to the students.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > Introduction

The admission, registration and assessment arrangements described below are in accordance with the University policies and regulations for all 4-year full-time undergraduate degree programmes and articulation degree programmes.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.1 Admission

Students in UGC-funded degree programmes will be recruited on a yearly basis.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.2 Re-admission

Students who have been required to withdraw on grounds of academic failure or have been deregistered, and those who have discontinued their studies without completing the proper procedures for official withdrawal, shall not be considered for re-admission to the same scheme/programme/stream in the following academic year.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.3 Transfer of study within the University

Students who have not completed their programmes of study may apply to transfer to another programme, and may be admitted, provided that the total period of registration will not exceed the normal duration of the original or new study programme, whichever is longer. Unless exceptionally approved by Academic Planning and Regulations Committee (APRC) Chairman, year one new students will only be considered for transfer to another programme offered in the same mode of study, starting from their second semester of registration.

Students who are currently on a UGC-funded programme and wish to transfer to another PolyU full-time UGC-funded programme of the same level should submit an application for transfer of study, instead of a new application in the non-JUPAS application period.

All applications for transfer of study will be considered in competition with other new applications.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.4 Concurrent Enrolment

Students are not permitted to enrol concurrently on two full-time UGC-funded programmes, whether or not one of the programmes is offered by another institution.

In addition, students are not allowed to enrol concurrently on more than one programme (regardless of the mode of study), including those offered by another institution, without permission from the Head(s) of Department concerned, except for programmes which do not lead to any formal award.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.5 Normal Duration for Completion of the Programme

Students should complete the programme within the normal duration of the programme as specified in the Programme Requirement Document. Those who exceed the normal duration of the programme will be de-registered from the programme unless prior approval has been obtained from relevant authorities. The study period of a student shall exclude deferment granted for justifiable reasons, and the semester(s) when the student has been approved to undertake internship. Any semester in which the students are allowed to take zero subject will be counted towards their total period of registration.

Students who have been registered for the normal duration of the programme may request extension of their studies for up to one year with the approval of the relevant Heads of Department/Deans of Independent School. Applications for extension of study period beyond one year and up to two years will require the approval from Faculty/School Board Chairman.

Students who have exceeded the normal duration of the programme for more than two years and have been de-registered can submit an appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee to request further extension. If the appeal fails, the student shall be de-registered.

To enable student sportsmen to manage their participation in trainings/competitions and academic studies, the normal duration for completion of programmes for students admitted via the OSRS will automatically be extended for two years. Further extension will follow the prevailing regulations.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.6 Validity Period of Subject Credits

The validity period of subject credits earned is eight years from the year of attainment, i.e., the year in which the subject is completed. Credits earned from previous study should remain valid at the time when the student applies for credit transfer.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.7 Residential Requirement

In order to be considered for a PolyU award, a student must complete at least 1/3 of the normal credit requirement for the award he/she is currently enrolled, unless the professional bodies concerned stipulate otherwise. This 1/3 requirement is also applicable to Minor programme and Secondary Major. Students must take at least 6 credits from their chosen Minor programme or at least 12 credits from their chosen Secondary Major in order to satisfy the residential requirement of their chosen Minor or Secondary Major.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.8 Subject Registration and Withdrawal (Part 1)

In addition to programme registration, students need to register for the subjects at specified periods prior to the commencement of the semester. An add/drop period will also be scheduled for each semester/term. Students may apply for withdrawal of their registration on a subject after the add/drop period and before the commencement of the examination period if they have a genuine need to do so. The application should be made to the relevant programme offering Department and will require the approval of both the subject teacher and the host Department Programme Leader concerned. Applications submitted after the commencement of the examination period will not be considered. For approved applications of subject withdrawal, the tuition fee paid for the subject will be forfeited and the withdrawal status of the subject will be shown in the assessment result notification and transcript of studies, but will not be counted in the calculation of the GPA.

The pre-requisite requirements of a subject must have been fulfilled before a student registers for that subject. However, the subject offering Department has the discretion to waive the prerequisite requirements of a subject, if deemed appropriate. If the pre-requisite subject concerned forms part of the requirements for award, the subject has to be passed in order to satisfy the graduation requirements for the programme concerned, despite the waiving of the pre-requisite.

Subject to the maximum study load of 21 credits per semester and the availability of study places, students are allowed to take additional subjects on top of the prescribed credit

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.8 Subject Registration and Withdrawal (Part 2)
requirement for award before they become eligible for graduation. Students will be allowed to take additional subjects for broadening purpose, after they fulfil the graduation requirements and for the following semester. However, they will still be subject to the maximum study load of 21 credits per semester and the availability of places in the subjects concerned, and their enrolment will be arranged as subject-based students only and be subject to the rules on 'Admission of Subject-based Students', except that graduates from UGC-funded programmes will not be restricted to taking only subjects from a self-financed programme.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.9 Study Load (Part 1)

For students following the progression pattern specified for their programme, they have to take the number of credits and subjects, as specified in this Programme Requirement Document, for each semester. Students cannot drop those subjects assigned by the department unless prior approval has been given by the department.

The normal study load is 15 credits in a semester for full-time study. The maximum study load to be taken by a student in a semester is 21 credits, unless exceptional approval is given by the Head of the programme offering department. For such cases, students should be reminded that the study load approved should not be taken as the grounds for academic appeal.

To help improve the academic performance of students on academic probation, these students will be required to take a reduced study load in the following semester (Summer Term excluded). The maximum number of credits to be taken by the students varies according to the policies of individual Departments and will be subject to the approval of the authorities concerned.

Students are not allowed to take zero subject in any semester, including the mandatory summer term as required by some programmes, unless they have obtained prior approval from the programme offering department; otherwise they will be classified as having unofficially withdrawn from their programme. Students who have been approved for zero subject enrolment (i.e., taking zero subject in a semester) are allowed to retain their student status and continue using campus facilities and library facilities. Any semester in which the students are allowed to take zero subject will nevertheless be counted towards the total period of registration.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.9 Study Load (Part 2)
Students who have obtained approval to pace their studies and students on programmes without any specified progression pattern who wish to take more than the normal load of 15 credits in a semester should seek advice from the Department concerned before the selection of subjects.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.10 Subject Exemption

Students may be exempted from taking any specified subjects, including mandatory GUR subjects, if they have successfully completed similar subjects previously in another programme or have demonstrated the level of proficiency/ability to the satisfaction of the subject offering Department. Subject exemption is normally decided by the subject offering Department. However, for applications which are submitted by students who have completed an approved student exchange programme, the subject exemption is to be decided by the programme offering Department in consultation with the subject offering Departments. If students are exempted from taking a specified subject, the credits associated with the exempted subject will not be counted towards meeting the award requirements. It will therefore be necessary for the students to consult the programme offering Department and take another subject in order to satisfy the credit requirement for the award.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.11 Credit Transfer (Part 1)

Students may be given credits for recognised previous studies including mandatory General University Requirements (GUR) subjects, and the credits will be counted towards meeting the requirements for award/degree. Transferred credits may not normally be counted towards more than one degree. The granting of credit transfer is a matter of academic judgment.

Credit transfer may be done with or without the grade being carried over; the former should normally be used when the credits were gained from PolyU. Credit transfer with the grade being carried over may be granted for subjects taken from outside the University, if deemed appropriate, and with due consideration to the academic equivalence of the subjects concerned and the comparability of the grading systems adopted by the University and the other approved institutions. Subject credit transfer is normally decided by the subject offering Department. However, for applications which are submitted by students who have completed an approved student exchange programme, the decision will be made by the programme offering Department in consultation with the subject offering Departments.

Normally, not more than  $50\%$  of the credit requirement for award may be transferable from approved institutions outside the University. For transfer of credits from programmes offered by PolyU, normally not more than  $67\%$  of the credit requirement for award can be transferred. In cases where both types of credits are being transferred (i.e. from programmes offered by PolyU and from approved institutions outside the University), not more than  $50\%$  of the credit requirement for award may be transferred. However, for students admitted to an Articulation Degree or Senior Year curriculum, which is already a reduced curriculum, they should not be given credit transfer for any required GUR subjects, and are required to complete at least 60 credits in order to be eligible for a Bachelor's award.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.11 Credit Transfer (Part 2)
With applications for transfer of credits earned through study under an approved exchange programme, students should seek approval on their study plan and credit transferability from the programme offering Department before they start the exchange programme. In order to overcome possible problems associated with subject-to-subject mappings, block credit transfer rather than subject-by-subject credit transfer can be given.

All credit transfers approved will take effect in the semester for which they are approved. A student who applies for transfer of credits for a particular semester will only be eligible for graduation at the end of that semester (even if the granting of credit transfer will immediately enable the student to satisfy the credit requirement for the award).

For credit transfer of retained subjects, the grade attained in the last attempt should be taken in the case of credit transfer with grade being carried over. Students applying for credit transfer for a subject taken in other institutions are required to declare that the subject grade used for claiming credit transfer was attained in the last attempt of the subject in their previous studies. If a student fails in the last attempt of a retained subject, no credit transfer should be granted, despite the fact that the student may have attained a pass grade for the subject in the earlier attempts.

Students should not be granted credit transfer for a subject which they have attempted and failed in their current study unless the subject was taken by the student as an exchange-out student in his/her current programme.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.12 Deferment of Study

Students may apply for deferment of study if they have a genuine need to do so such as illness or posting to work outside Hong Kong. Approval from the Department offering the programme is required. The deferment period will not be counted towards the total period of registration.

Application for deferment of study from students who have not yet completed the first year of a full-time programme will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.

Where the period of deferment of study begins during a stage for which fees have been paid, no refund of such fees will be made.

Students who have been approved for deferment are not entitled to enjoy any campus facilities during the deferment period.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.13 General Assessment Regulations

Students progress by credit accumulation, i.e., credits earned by passing individual subjects can be accumulated and counted towards the final award.

A 'level' in a programme indicates the intellectual demand placed upon students and may characterise each subject with respect to its recommended sequencing within that programme. Upper level subjects should normally build on lower level subjects. Pre-requisite requirements, if any, must therefore be spelt out on a subject basis.

A 'subject' is defined as a discrete section of the programme which is assigned a separate assessment. A list of subjects, together with their level and weightings, shall be published in the Programme Requirement Document.

The language of assessment for all programmes/subjects shall be English, unless approval is given for it to be otherwise.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.14 Principles of Assessment

Assessment of learning and assessment for learning are both important for assuring the quality of student learning. Assessment of learning is to evaluate whether students have achieved the intended learning outcomes of the subjects that they have taken and have attained the overall learning outcomes of the academic programme at the end of their study at a standard appropriate to the award. Appropriate methods of assessment that align with the intended learning outcomes should be designed for this purpose. The assessment methods will also enable the teacher to differentiate students' different levels of performance within the subject. Assessment for learning is to engage students in productive learning activities through purposefully designed assessment tasks.

Assessment will also serve as feedback to students. The assessment criteria and standards should be made explicit to students before the start of the assessment to facilitate student learning, and feedback provided should link to the criteria and standards. Timely feedback should be provided to students so that they are aware of their progress and attainment for the purpose of improvement.

The ultimate authority in the University for the confirmation of academic decisions is the Senate, but for practical reasons, the Senate has delegated to the Faculty/School Boards the authority to confirm the decisions of Boards of Examiners provided these are made within the framework of the General Assessment Regulations. Recommendations from Board of Examiners which fall outside these Regulations shall be ratified by the APRC and reported to the Senate as necessary.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.15 Assessment Methods

Students' performance in a subject can be assessed by continuous assessment and/or examinations, at the discretion of the individual subject offering department. Where both continuous assessment and examinations are used, the weighting of each in the overall subject grade shall be clearly stated in the Programme Requirement Document. The subject offering department can decide whether students are required to pass both the continuous assessment and examination components, or either component only, in order to obtain a subject pass, but this requirement (to pass both, or either, components) shall be specified in the Programme Requirement Document. Learning outcome should be assessed by continuous assessment and/or examination appropriately, in line with the outcome-based approach.

Continuous assessment may include tests, assignments, projects, laboratory work, field exercises, presentations and other forms of classroom participation. Continuous Assessment assignments which involve group work should nevertheless include some individual components therein. The contribution made by each student in continuous assessment involving a group effort shall be determined and assessed separately, and this can result in different grades being awarded to students in the same group.

Assessment methods and parameters of subjects shall be determined by the subject offering department.

At the beginning of each semester, the subject teacher should inform students of the details of the methods of assessments to be used, within the assessment framework as specified in the Programme Requirement Document.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.16 Progression / Academic Probation / Deregistration (Part 1)

The Board of Examiners shall, at the end of each semester (except for Summer Term unless there are students who are eligible to graduate after completion of Summer Term subjects or the Summer Term study is mandatory for the programme), determine whether each student is

(i) eligible for progression towards an award; or  
(ii) eligible for an award; or  
(iii) required to be deregistered from the programme.

When a student has a Grade Point Average (GPA) lower than 1.70, he/she will be put on academic probation in the following semester. If a student is able to pull his/her GPA up to 1.70 or above at the end of the semester, the status of "academic probation" will be lifted. The status of "academic probation" will be reflected in the assessment result notification but not in the transcript of studies.

A student will have 'progressing' status unless he/she falls within any one of the following categories, which may be regarded as grounds for deregistration from the programme:

(i) the student has reached the final year of the normal period of registration for that programme, as specified in the Programme Requirement Document, unless approval has been given for extension; or  
(ii) the student has reached the maximum number of retakes allowed for a failed compulsory subject; or  
(iii) the student's GPA is lower than 1.70 for two consecutive semesters and his/her Semester GPA in the second semester is also lower than 1.70; or  
(iv) the student's GPA is lower than 1.70 for three consecutive semesters.

When a student falls within any of the categories as stipulated above, except for category (i) with approval for extension, the Board of Examiners shall de-register the student from the programme without exception.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.16 Progression / Academic Probation / Deregistration (Part 2)
A student may be de-registered from the programme enrolled before the time frame specified at (iii) or (iv) above if his/her academic performance is poor to the extent that the Board of Examiners deems that his/her chance of attaining a GPA of 1.70 at the end of the programme is slim or impossible.

The progression of students to the following academic year will not be affected by the GPA obtained in the Summer Term, unless Summer Term study is mandatory for all students of the programme and constitutes a requirement for graduation, and is so specified in the Programme Requirement Document.

If the student is not satisfied with the de-registration decision of the Board of Examiners, he/she can lodge an appeal. All such appeal cases will be referred directly to Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) for final decision. Views of Faculties/Schools/Departments will be sought and made available to AAC for reference.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.17 Retaking of Subjects (Part 1)

Students may only retake a subject which they have failed (i.e. Grade F or S or U). Retaking of subjects is with the condition that the maximum study load of 21 credits per semester is not exceeded.

The number of retakes of a subject should be restricted to two, i.e., a maximum of three attempts for each subject is allowed.

In cases where a student takes another subject to replace a failed elective subject, the fail grade will be taken into account in the calculation of the GPA, despite the passing of the replacement subject. Likewise, students who fail a Cluster Area Requirement (CAR) subject may need to take another subject from the same Cluster Area in order to fulfill this part of the GUR, since the original CAR subject may not be offered; in such cases, the fail grade for the first CAR subject will be taken into account in the calculation of the GPA, despite the passing of the second CAR subject. Note

Students need to submit a request to the Faculty/School Board for the second retake of a failed subject.

Students who have failed a compulsory subject after two retakes and have been de-registered can submit an appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) for a third chance of retaking the subject.

In case AAC does not approve further retakes of a failed compulsory subject or the taking of an equivalent subject with special approval from the Faculty, the student concerned would be de-registered and the decision of the AAC shall be final within the University.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.17 Retaking of Subjects (Part 2)
Note: In these circumstances when students do not have a choice to retake a failed subject, such as when the failed subject has been phased out, a 'tie-subject' arrangement can be made with the approval of the Faculty Board. Under the arrangement, another appropriate subject can be taken as equivalent to the subject which is not offered. Upon passing the equivalent subject, the fail grade of the original subject will be replaced by the latest grade of the retake subject and the failure grade of the original subject will not be taken into account in the calculation of the GPA.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.18 Absence from an assessment component

If a student is unable to complete all the assessment components of a subject, due to illness or other circumstances which are beyond his/her control and considered by the subject offering Department as legitimate, the Department will determine whether the student will have to complete a late assessment and, if so, by what means. This late assessment shall take place at the earliest opportunity, and normally before the commencement of the following academic year (except that for Summer Term, which may take place within 3 weeks after the finalisation of Summer Term results). If the late assessment cannot be completed before the commencement of the following academic year, the Faculty/School Board Chairman shall decide on an appropriate time for completion of the late assessment.

The student concerned is required to submit his/her application for late assessment in writing to the Head of Department offering the subject, within five working days from the date of the examination, together with any original supporting documents. Approval of applications for late assessment and the means for such late assessments shall be given by the Head of Department offering the subject or the subject teacher concerned, in consultation with the Programme Leader. Verification of the supporting documents with the issuing authority may be conducted by the subject offering Department as part of the approval process.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.19 Aegrotat Award

If a student is unable to complete the requirements of the programme in question for the award due to very serious illness, or other very special circumstances which are beyond his/her control, and considered by the Board of Examiners as legitimate, the Faculty/School Board will determine whether the student will be granted an aegrotat award. Aegrotat award will be granted under very exceptional circumstances.

A student who has been offered an aegrotat award shall have the right to opt either to accept such an award, or request to be assessed on another occasion to be stipulated by the Board of Examiners; the student's exercise of this option shall be irrevocable.

The acceptance of an aegrotat award by a student shall disqualify him from any subsequent assessment for the same award.

An aegrotat award shall normally not be classified, and the award parchment shall not state that it is an aegrotat award. However, the Board of Examiners may determine whether the award should be classified, provided that they have adequate information on the students' academic performance.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.20 Grading (Part 1)

Assessment grades shall be awarded on a criterion-referenced basis. A student's overall performance in a subject shall be graded as follows from 2020/21 onwards:



## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.20 Grading (Part 2)
| Subject grade | Short description | Elaboration on subject grading description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A+ | Excellent | Demonstrates excellent achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to skillfully use concepts and solve complex problems. Shows evidence of innovative and critical thinking in unfamiliar situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner. |
| A | Excellent | Demonstrates excellent achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to skillfully use concepts and solve complex problems. Shows evidence of innovative and critical thinking in unfamiliar situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner. |
| A- | Excellent | Demonstrates excellent achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to skillfully use concepts and solve complex problems. Shows evidence of innovative and critical thinking in unfamiliar situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner. |
| B+ | Good | Demonstrates good achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to use appropriate concepts and solve problems. Shows the ability to analyse issues critically and make well-grounded judgements in familiar or standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner. |
| B | Good | Demonstrates good achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to use appropriate concepts and solve problems. Shows the ability to analyse issues critically and make well-grounded judgements in familiar or standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner. |

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.20 Grading (Part 3)
| Subject grade | Short description | Elaboration on subject grading description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B- | Good | Demonstrates good achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to use appropriate concepts and solve problems. Shows the ability to analyse issues critically and make well-grounded judgements in familiar or standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a logical and comprehensive manner. |
| C+ | Satisfactory | Demonstrates satisfactory achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Shows some capacity for analysis and making judgements in a variety of familiar and standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a manner that is generally logical but fragmented. |
| C | Satisfactory | Demonstrates satisfactory achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Shows some capacity for analysis and making judgements in a variety of familiar and standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a manner that is generally logical but fragmented. |
| C- | Satisfactory | Demonstrates satisfactory achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Shows some capacity for analysis and making judgements in a variety of familiar and standard situations, and is able to express the synthesis or application of ideas in a manner that is generally logical but fragmented. |
| D+ | Pass | Demonstrates marginal achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Can make basic comparisons, connections and judgments and express the ideas learnt in the subject, though there are frequent breakdowns in logic and clarity. |

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.20 Grading (Part 4)
| Subject grade | Short description | Elaboration on subject grading description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D | Pass | Demonstrates marginal achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Can make basic comparisons, connections and judgments and express the ideas learnt in the subject, though there are frequent breakdowns in logic and clarity. |
| D | Pass | Demonstrates marginal achievement of intended subject learning outcomes by being able to solve relatively simple problems. Can make basic comparisons, connections and judgments and express the ideas learnt in the subject, though there are frequent breakdowns in logic and clarity. |
| F | Fail | Demonstrates inadequate achievement of intended subject learning outcomes through a lack of knowledge and/or understanding of the subject matter. Evidence of analysis is often irrelevant or incomplete. |



'F' is a subject failure grade, whilst all others ('D' to 'A+') are subject passing grades. No credit will be earned if a subject is failed.

Indicative descriptors for modifier grades



| Main Grade (solid) | The student generally performed at this level, indicating mastery of the subject intended learning outcomes at this level. |
| --- | --- |
| + (exemplary) | The student consistently performed at this level and exceeded the expectations of this level in some regards, but not enough to claim mastery at the next level. |
| - (marginal) | The student basically performed at this level, but the performance was inconsistent or fell slightly short in some regards. |



Note: The above indicative descriptors for modifier grades are not applicable to the pass grades D and D+

A numeral grade point is assigned to each subject grade. The grade points assigned to subject grades attained by students from 2020/21 are as follows:



## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.20 Grading (Part 5)
| Grade | Grade Point for grades attained |
| --- | --- |
| A+ | 4.3 |
| A | 4.0 |
| A- | 3.7 |
| B+ | 3.3 |
| B | 3.0 |
| B- | 2.7 |
| C+ | 2.3 |
| C | 2.0 |
| C- | 1.7 |
| D+ | 1.3 |
| D | 1.0 |
| F | 0.0 |



At the end of each semester/term, a Grade Point Average (GPA) will be computed as follows, and based on the grade point of all the subjects:

$$
G P A = \frac {\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \text {S u b j e c t G r a d e P o i n t} _ {n} \times \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {n}}{\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {n}}
$$

where  $\mathrm{N} =$  number of all subjects (inclusive of failed subjects) taken by the student up to and including the latest semester/term. For subjects which have been retaken, only the grade point obtained in the final attempt will be included in the GPA calculation

In addition, the following subjects will be excluded from the GPA calculation:

(i) Exempted subjects  
(ii) Ungraded subjects  
(iii) Incomplete subjects  
(iv) Subjects for which credit transfer has been approved, but without any grade assigned  
(v) Subjects from which a student has been allowed to withdraw (i.e., those with the code 'W')

Subject which has been given an "S" code, i.e., absent from all assessment components, will be included in the GPA calculation and will be counted as "zero" grade point. GPA is thus the unweighted cumulative average calculated for a student, for all relevant subjects taken from the start of the programme to a particular point of time. GPA is an indicator of overall performance, and ranges from 0.00 to 4.30 from 2020/21.

All training credits will be counted in the GPA calculation but not in the WGPA calculation.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.21 Different types of GPA (Part 1)

GPA's will be calculated for each Semester including the Summer Term. This Semester GPA will be used to determine students' eligibility to progress to the next Semester alongside with the 'cumulative GPA'. However, the Semester GPA calculated for the Summer Term will not be used for this purpose, unless the Summer Term study is mandatory for all students of the programme concerned and constitutes part of the graduation requirements.

The GPA calculated after the second Semester of the students' study is therefore a 'cumulative' GPA of all the subjects taken so far by students, and without applying any level weighting.

Along with the 'cumulative' GPA, a weighted GPA will also be calculated, to give an indication to the Board of Examiners on the award classification which a student will likely get if he/she makes steady progress on his/her academic studies.

When a student has satisfied the requirements for award, an award GPA will be calculated to determine his/her award classification.

For students taking the Major/Minor study route, a separate GPA will be calculated for their Major and Minor programmes. The Major GPA will be used to determine their award classification, which will be so reflected on the award parchment. The Minor GPA can be used as a reference for Board of Examiners to moderate the award classification for the Major,

For students taking the Major/Secondary Major study route, there is no separate "Secondary Major GPA". The Major GPA is the weighted GPA of all subjects contributing to the Major and Secondary Major.

The calculation methods of the different types of GPA are further explained in the table below.



## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.21 Different types of GPA (Part 2)
| Types of GPA | Purpose | Rules for GPA calculation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPA | Determine Progression/ Graduation | (1) All academic subjects taken by the student throughout his/her study, both inside and outside the programme curriculum, are included in the GPA calculation. (2) For training subjects, including WIE and Clinical/Field subjects, departments can decide whether to include them in the GPA calculation. (3) For retake subjects, only the last attempt will be taken in the GPA calculation. (4) Level weighting, if any, will be ignored. |
| Semester GPA | Determine Progression | Similar to the rules for GPA as described above, except that only subjects taken in that Semester, including retaken subjects, will be included in the calculation. |
| Weighted GPA | To give an interim indication on the likely Award GPA | (1) Similar to the rules for GPA, except that only subjects inside the programme curriculum concerned will be included in the calculation. Subjects outside the programme curriculum will be excluded. (2) Departments can decide whether the training subjects are to be counted towards the Weighted GPA. (3) For retake subjects, only the last attempt will be taken in the Weighted GPA calculation. (4) A weighting of 2 for Level 1 and 2 subjects, and a weighting of 3 for Level 3 and above, will be included in the calculation to determine the Honours classifications for Bachelor's degree programmes. (5) The weighted GPA will be the same as the Award GPA unless a student has taken more subjects than required. |

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.21 Different types of GPA (Part 3)
| Types of GPA | Purpose | Rules for GPA calculation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Major/Minor GPA | For reference and determination of award classification | Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) /Minor GPA (1) Only subjects inside the curriculum of the Major/Minor Programmes will be taken in the Major/Minor GPA calculation. (2) Departments can decide whether the training subjects, are to be counted towards the Major/Minor GPA. (3) For retake subjects, only the last attempt will be taken in the Major/Minor GPA calculation. (4) Up to 6 credits from the Major/GUR [including Language Communication Requirements (LCR) subjects at proficiency level] can be counted towards the chosen Minor. Nevertheless, students must take at least 6 credits from their chosen Minor programme in order to satisfy the residential requirement of their chosen Minor. In addition, to be eligible for the Major and Minor awards, the total number of credits taken by the students for their Major-Minor studies must not be lower than the credit requirement of the single discipline Major programme. Major GPA Level weighting will be included in the calculation of Major GPA. Minor GPA Level weighting will not be included in the calculation of Minor GPA. |
| Award GPA | For determination of award classification | If the student has not taken more subjects than required, the Award GPA will be as follows: (1) For single Major: Award GPA = Weighted GPA (2) For Major/Minor programmes: Award GPA = Major GPA (3) For programmes without level weighting: Award GPA = GPA If the student has taken more subjects than required, refer to Section 7.23 below. |



## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.22 Guidelines for Award Classification (Part 1)

The Weighted GPA will be used as a guide to help determine award classifications.

Weighted GPA will be computed as follows:

$$
\text {W e i g h t e d G P A} = \frac {\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \text {S u b j e c t G r a p e P o i n t} _ {n} \times \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {n} \times W _ {n}}{\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} \text {S u b j e c t C r e d i t V a l u e} _ {n} \times W _ {n}}
$$

where  $W_{n} =$  weighting to be assigned according to the level of the subject

$\mathbf{N} =$  number of all subjects counted in GPA calculation

For calculating the weighted GPA (and award GPA) to determine the Honours classification of students who satisfy the graduation requirements of Bachelor's degree awards, a University-wide standard weighting will be applied to all subjects of the same level, with a weighting of  $\underline{2}$  for Level 1 and 2 subjects and a weighting of  $\underline{3}$  for Level 3 and above subjects. Same as for GPA, Weighted GPA ranges from 0.00 to 4.30 from 2020/21.

Any subjects passed after the graduation requirement has been met or subjects taken on top of the prescribed credit requirements for award shall not be taken into account in the grade point calculation for award classification. However, if a student attempts more elective subjects (or optional subjects) than those required for graduation in or before the semester in which he/she becomes eligible for award, the elective subjects (or optional subjects), except for subjects which are selected by students to fulfill the free electives requirement for graduation, with a higher grade/contribution shall be included in the grade point calculation (i.e., the excessive subjects attempted with a lower grade/contribution, including failed subjects, will be excluded).

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.22 Guidelines for Award Classification (Part 2)
For students who have completed a Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option)/Minor programme, a single classification will be awarded and their award classification will mainly be based on the "Major GPA", but it can be moderated by the Board of Examiners with reference to the "Minor GPA". For students who have completed a Major programme combined with free electives, their award classification will be determined by their "Major GPA" which includes grades obtained for the free electives, if appropriate.

"Major GPA" is derived based on all subjects of the Major programme, as well as the Secondary Major programme, if any, including those meeting the mandatory General University Requirements (GUR) and programme-specific language requirement, but not necessarily including the training credits.

"Minor GPA" is derived based on the 18 credits of specific Minor programme. "Minor GPA" is unweighted.

The "Major GPA" and the "Minor GPA" will be presented separately to the Board of Examiners for consideration. The guidelines for determining award classification are applicable to programmes with Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option)/Minor studies.

Where a student has a high GPA for his/her Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) but a lower GPA for his/her Minor, he/she will not be 'penalised' in respect of his/her award classification, which is attached to the Major. On the other hand, if a student has a lower GPA for his/her Major (including the Major/Secondary Major option) than his/her GPA for the Minor, the Board of Examiners may consider recommending a higher award classification for the student for ratification by the APRC via the Faculty/School Board.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.23 Classification of Awards (Part 1)

For Honours degree programmes, the awards will be classified as follows:

First Class Honours  
Second Class Honours (Division 1)  
Second Class Honours (Division 2)  
Third Class Honours

The following are guidelines for Boards of Examiners' reference in determining award classifications:



| Honours Degrees | Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | The student's performance/attainment is outstanding, and identifies him/her as exceptionally able in the field covered by the programme in question. |
| 2:i | The student has reached a standard of performance/attainment which is more than satisfactory but less than outstanding. |
| 2:ii | The student has reached a standard of performance/attainment judged to be satisfactory, and clearly higher than the 'essential minimum' required for graduation. |
| 3rd | The student has attained the ‘essential minimum’ required for graduation at a standard ranging from just adequate to just satisfactory. |



Under exceptional circumstances, a student who has completed an Honours degree programme, but has not attained Honours standard, may be awarded a Pass-without-Honours degree. A Pass-without-Honours degree award will be recommended, when the student has demonstrated a level of final attainment which is below the 'essential minimum' required for graduation with Honours from the programme in question, but when he/she has nonetheless covered the prescribed work of the programme in an adequate fashion, while failing to show sufficient evidence of the intellectual calibre expected of Honours degree graduates. For example, if a student in an Honours degree programme has a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 1.70 or more, but his/her Weighted GPA is less than 1.70, he/she may be considered for a Pass-without-Honours classification. A Pass-without-Honours is an unclassified award, but the award parchment will not include this specification.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.23 Classification of Awards (Part 2)
Students who have committed academic dishonesty or non-compliance with examination regulations will be subject to the penalty of the lowering of award classification by one level. For undergraduate students who should be awarded a Third class Honours degree, they will be downgraded to a Pass-without-Honours. The minimum of downgraded overall result will be kept at a Pass.

The followings are the award GPA ranges for determining award classifications:



| Honours Degrees | Award GPA |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 3.60 – 4.30 |
| 2:i | 3.00 – 3.59 |
| 2:ii | 2.40 – 2.99 |
| 3rd | 1.70 – 2.39 |



Decisions by the Boards of Examiners on award classifications to be granted to each student on completion of the programme shall be ratified by the Faculty/School Board (of Examiners). For cases the decisions of which do not conform to the above indicative GPA range, they should be referred, by the Faculty/School Board (of Examiners), to the APRC for ratification.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.24 Examination result announcements, transcripts, testimonials and references (Part 1)

At the end of each semester, where appropriate, examination results are announced online for individual students' checking. It provides information on subjects taken and grades attained, the Grade Point Average (GPA) for all subjects, and the overall result up to and including the latest semester. The announcement serves as an official notification of the student's academic performance.

A formal Transcript of Studies will be issued by the University, upon request, to any student registered on a programme offered by the University, and it will include the following information:

(i) name and student number;  
(ii) title of the programme(s) on which enrolled, or from which graduated;  
(iii) medium of instruction for the programme (applicable only to programmes which are delivered in Chinese and for which both Chinese and English versions are offered);  
(iv) a full academic record, giving subjects taken and grades attained, and the Grade Point Average (GPA) for all subjects (this shall include any practical training undertaken, which fulfill the training credit requirement of the programme concerned);  
(v) credit requirement of the student if different from the normal credit requirement of the programme;  
(vi) where relevant, the final award(s) (including information on the Secondary Major and/or Minor award, if appropriate), with classification and year of award;  
(vii) a statement indicating that the student has completed the Work-integrated Education (WIE) activities / Healthy Lifestyle / e-learning course in Putonghua (offered as an option with effect from the 2018/19 intake cohort), as appropriate; and  
(viii) information on the partner institution, if the award is for a dual degree/joint programme with another institution and leads to a dual/joint award.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.24 Examination result announcements, transcripts, testimonials and references (Part 2)
Students may request for a testimonial which is a certification of their studies at the University, but without details on subjects and subject results.

Students may also request for references direct from academic staff members concerned.

## 7 Academic Regulations on Admission, Registration and Assessment > 7.25 Recording of disciplinary actions in students' records

With effect from Semester One of 2015/16, disciplinary actions against students' misconducts will be recorded in students' records.

Students who are found guilty of academic dishonesty or non-compliance with examination regulations will be subject to the penalty of having the subject result concerned disqualified and be given a failure grade with a remark denoting 'Disqualification of result due to academic dishonesty/noncompliance with examination regulations'. The remark will be shown in the students' record as well as the assessment result notification and transcript of studies, until their leaving the University.

Students who have committed disciplinary offences (covering both academic and non-academic related matters) will be put on 'disciplinary probation'. The status of 'disciplinary probation' will be shown in the students' record as well as the assessment result notification, transcript of studies and testimonial during the probation period, until their leaving the University. The disciplinary probation is normally one year unless otherwise decided by the Student Discipline Committee.

The University reserves the right to withhold the issuance of any certificate of study to a student/graduand who has unsettled matters with the University, or subject to is disciplinary action.

## Appendix II > Introduction

Secondary Major in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA)

## Appendix II > 1 Rationale for AIDA

Data has been characterised as the new oil; it is valuable only if it can be refined into a form that drives profitable and productive activity. Artificial intelligence and data analytics (AIDA) are undoubtedly the most prevailing technologies to carry out such a refinement process and are the most important driving forces in our data-driven society today. Through the rapid technological developments of the 21st Century, big data has become available, and with remarkable success in the past decade. AIDA is thus becoming a de-facto standard approach to enrich business, advance technology and achieve breakthroughs in virtually all fields. Therefore, it is essential for students to possess expertise in AIDA and other underpinning technologies.

PolyU is fully aware of the opportunities and challenges brought about by the new economy and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and believes that it is indispensable for the next generation of workforce to possess expertise in AIDA and other underpinning technologies such as robotics, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and blockchain, to name a few.

## Appendix II > 2 Aims and Objectives for AIDA

The AIDA Secondary Major is designed in response to the rapidly developing fields of artificial intelligence and data analytics that are currently gaining unprecedented traction in industry as well as generating demand for qualified professionals in the job market. By integrating within the major discipline of the student, this secondary major aims to produce the next generation of graduates skilled with AI computational thinking and data analytics acumen in their chosen discipline to meet the needs of society, help improve efficiencies and augment human capabilities.

This secondary major comprises interdisciplinary and integrated programmes to equip students with a strong foundation in computer science, statistics and mathematics, so as to nurture them to make use of AIDA techniques to solve contemporary problems in a discipline of their choice.

Each academic programme offering the option of this secondary major will incorporate a block of AIDA subjects (such as programming, mathematics, statistics, big data, AI and machine learning) into the study of the academic programme focusing on a particular discipline or domain. Students will complete their study within the normal programme duration and graduate with their respective bachelor's degree, equipped with technical skills related to AIDA, coupled with the domain knowledge from a block of subjects either specially designed, or chosen from the corresponding academic programme, in addition to the GUR subjects. An Integrated Capstone Project (ICP) will be included, with the aim of developing the capabilities of a student in analysing and solving complex and potential real-life problems, as well as training them in skills related to systematic development and documentation of a significant piece of work.

## Appendix II > 3 Programme's Intended Learning Outcomes (PILOs)

On successful completion of this secondary major in AIDA, students will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamentals of AIDA, and have the ability to apply them.  
2. Design AIDA systems, components and processes to meet given specifications and constraints.  
3. Identify, formulate and solve problems relevant to AIDA.  
4. Use modern IT tools appropriate to AIDA practice.  
5. Know the contemporary issues, and understand the impact of AIDA solutions in a global and societal context.

## Appendix II > 4 Selection Mechanism

Studying a Secondary Major is a free choice by students and not mandatory. Only students with a Cumulative GPA of 2.70 or above may be considered for Secondary Major enrolment. Students must apply to and obtain approval from their programme offering Department, no later than the commencement of the second year of study, to be admitted to the Secondary Major.
